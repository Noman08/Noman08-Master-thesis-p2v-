850986,"To Whom it May Concern, I successfully opened a checking account with Wells Fargo Bank in  XX/XX/XXXX and was allowed to make an initial deposit of {$50.00} online. At the time, Wells Fargo was offering an account opening bonus of {$250.00} and there was a minimum balance of {$1500.00} in order to avoid a monthly service fee. I mailed a check for {$1500.00} that same week in order to bring my balance over that threshold.
A couple of weeks later, my check was returned to me in the mail with a note saying that I needed to go into a branch with a photo ID to verify my identity. The closest branch is 1 hour and 22 minutes from my home -- nearly a 3 hour round trip drive. I called to inquire as to why my check was returned. I was told over the phone in   XXXX   that I could re-send a check for my {$1500.00} deposit. On  XX/XX/XXXX , I wrote a second check and mailed it out the next day. I never received any further notice about this deposit.
Recently, I received a statement from Wells Fargo showing that my account balance is only {$30.00} as of  XX/XX/XXXX , when a second monthly maintenance fee of {$10.00} was charged to the account. It appears that they never deposited my second check for {$1500.00}.
I called today,  XX/XX/XXXX  and was told that the only thing I can do is appear in person at a branch. Despite my pleas for understanding that the drive to a branch is an undue burden, the bank refused to speak with my about the account and told me that they could not answer any further questions. They hung up the phone on me.
At this point, it appears to me that Wells Fargo did not open this account in good faith. My impression is that they never intended to allow me to deposit and rather were looking to steal my money in the form of monthly maintenance fees. I 've been told that I can not even close my account over the phone. Effectively, the bank has told me that they will continue to debit my account to {$0.00} unless I drive 3 hours round trip to prove that I am me. As a business owner with excellent credit who has lived at the same address for almost my entire life, I ca n't believe that Wells Fargo has had any difficulty in identifying me. They could easily   XXXX   my name and verify every piece of information I have provided as to my knowledge I am the only person in the entire United States with my name and I do own a sizable business in the hometown I have lived in since my birth in  XX/XX/XXXX . Furthermore, if they could not verify my identity, why would they have let me open an account and make a deposit? At this point, the only answer I can surmise is that they intended to take advantage of my distance from a branch all along. I wonder how many others ' accounts they have pilfered under the guise of "" not being able to verify identity ''.
I was unfairly charged a fee on an account that I twice tried in good faith to deposit money into in order to avoid a fee. The bank has refused to speak with me over the phone.

The response came from XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was unable to respond to the response in a timely manner due to illness. I am now bringing this complaint against XXXX XXXX as representative for Ocwen for defamation of character of myself and my husband in her response to the complaint. It is filled with lies and she is aware the statements are lies. 
1. In her response to our statement that XXXX XXXX ( the prior servicer of our loan ) did not apply payments for over 6 months, she said that we did not make payments in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX so XXXX held our payments in suspense. 
XXXX XXXX is quite aware that there were no payments due in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX per the XXXX XXXX XXXX. This agreement recast the XXXX and XXXX interest and added it to the principal and the first payment of the modification was due on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The contract is a simple, clear, unambiguous contract that states the above. Seeing as she is a practicing attorney it would be proper to believe that XXXX XXXX is capable of reading a simple contract. Other business records such as the payment records and the phone records support the contract and that no payment was due for XXXX of XXXX of XXXX. 
2. In response to our statement that Ocwen/Saxon has been trying to steal our home she states that our statement is false because we continue to live in the house while we fight the litigation after our default. We did not actually default. We stopped paying the mortgage payment for 2 reasons. 1-because we are exercising our right under the material breach of contract laws and 2-because the damages caused by this breach devastated us financially and we had no way to pay anything and were forced to let the matter go to court so we could countersue for material breach of contract. It is the mortgage holder that initially delayed the litigation for almost 4 years after the initial filing of the foreclosure because they did nothing. They did nothing because they were in the wrong. The case went through a couple of law firms before XXXX XXXX XXXX took on the case. My guess would be because other firms did not want stoop to falsifying evidence to defend a corrupt client. But XXXX XXXX does not seem to have a problem with it. 
3. In response to our statement that Ocwen materially breached the contract XXXX XXXX states we breached our mortgage and note. NO WE DID NOT. We have evidence and facts that show that XXXX breached the contract in a way that can be construed a material ; they did not apply on time payments from the inception of the XXXX XXXX XXXX for many months and not until an attorney got involved. As soon as we discovered our legal recourse we took action under the belief that their actions constitute a material breach of contract. Ocwen accepted the prior actions of XXXX when they took on the servicing of the loan. 
4. In response to our statement that there were no payments due in XXXX or XXXX XXXX she lies and says there were payments due. Again we can revert to the very simple reading of a contract and common sense. We entered into a XXXX XXXX agreement in XXXX XXXX. We negotiated this agreement because of financial hardship. The modification required a down payment in XXXX XXXX that was clearly paid per all records, BUT WAS UNAPPLIED. The contract clearly states that the interest for the XXXX and XXXX payments was to be recast and ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL. The contract also clearly states the first modification payment due is XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The phone records concur with the phrase next due XXXX dated in XXXX. Yet XXXX XXXX states we owed 2 FULL, unmodified payments in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX that we didnt pay. 
XXXX XXXX states the contract says that a payment was due XXXX XXXX, XXXX. She conveniently fails to state the rest of what the contract states in reference to a payment on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It clearly states that the payment for XXXX XXXX is to be paid by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It was XXXX payment due by XXXX XXXX that the contract CLEARLY states. That was part of the modification terms. We fell behind in XXXX due to confusion about the modification process. To get approved we had to pay XXXX XXXX payment by XXXX XXXX, XXXX, make a down payment in XXXX XXXX and get the paperwork in by a specific date in XXXX XXXX. 
In XXXX XXXX lie, we were required to pay a down payment, 2 unmodified payments for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and XXXX payment for the modification to be due on XXXX XXXX. 
Anyone who has had a modification or a refinance or a mortgage knows that there is a month or 2 before a payment becomes due. With XXXX XXXX logic we would have been paying more than our mortgage payments to get a modification to help us in a financial hardship. How would that help? There would be no point. Basic common sense and contract law refute her lies. 
This is just another lie ; twisting the truth to defame us 5. In response to our statement that our credit has been damaged she refers to credit reporting after XXXX when we stopped performance of the contract due to their material breach. Although this isnt a straight up lie her response is meant to defer and defame. 

Our statement was based on the negative credit reporting in XXXX when we were paying as required and XXXX was not applying our payments and was reporting them as late payments to the credit bureaus. 

6. In response to our statement that XXXX XXXX committed perjury in his affidavit XXXX XXXX states that he did not commit perjury. Let me refer to the XXXX law dictionary definition of perjury : The willful assertion as to a matter of fact, opinion, belief, or knowledge, made by a witness in a judicial proceeding as part of his evidence, either upon oath or in any form allowed by law to be substituted for an oath, whether such evidence is given in open court, or in an affidavit, or otherwise, such assertion being known to such witness to be false, and being intended by him to mislead the court, jury, or person holding the proceeding. 

In XXXX XXXX affidavit he asserts his knowledge and expertise in accounting for Ocwen. It would be proper to believe that someone of his expertise would be able to read a simple contract that sets out the requirements of our financial obligations to the mortgage holder. 
So he is either lying about the accounting or he is lying about his credentials. Both are perjury by definition. 

It becomes clear in his accounting when he starts out stating that we are delinquent by 2 payments in XXXX but suddenly in XXXX we are no longer delinquent yet we did not make any extra payments ; only 1 per  month. He did not explain how we suddenly were no longer delinquent without extra payments. But the payment records show how XXXX applied the previously unapplied payments in XXXX. And that is how we magically were no longer delinquent. Unfortunately we had already suffered irreparable damages within that 8 month time frame that coincides with the housing market crash of XXXX. 

Subornation of perjury is defined by XXXX XXXX XXXX as the offense of procuring another to take such a false oath as would constitute perjury in the principal. XXXX XXXX procured the affidavit of XXXX XXXX. It is only common sense to conclude that she committed subornation of perjury. 


The statements in XXXX XXXX response to our original complaint, constitutes defamation of character. She presented this defamatory letter to the CFPB.",Mortgage

The salesman misrepresented the service, they do not have high definition boxes and will not have them for 6-12 months. I asked to cancel the XXXX service due to misrepresentation within 3 weeks of signing the contract, but they refused. The only reason it took me this long to cancel was that they continued to lie to me, telling me the internet at my house was n't of good quality. I cancelled the service and told them that I would not pay for two years of a service that could not even be provided to me. 

I then called Chase bank to discontinue auto draws for the service. The Chase representative told me that he could n't stop the payments, which I did n't understand. He then told me that if I cancelled my card and got a new number that the auto withdraws would not be able to go through. I did as he suggested and cancelled the XXXX card, and got a XXXX one. 

In XXXX Chase bank allowed a credit withdrawl on my new card from XXXX XXXX for the full amount of the 2 year contract for {$430.00}. I never gave the new card number to XXXX XXXX. I do not know how they got access to the new number that Chase told me was safe.

I spoke with chase about the different rates and  XXXX   XXXX  (  XXXX   XXXX  | MB Sr Loan Processor |  XXXX  ID  XXXX   XXXX  Mortgage Banking  | Chase  |  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , WI  XXXX   |  Office :  XXXX  EXT.  XXXX  | Fax :  XXXX  |  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  ) told us that she could not guarantee any rate, but that since I have excellent credit and numerous accounts with Chase that she would try her best to match the 4.5 % rate. We told her the terms that we were comfortable with ; initially only seeking {$30000.00} for a remodel.  XXXX  explained that the rates were based off of a {$50000.00} loan, but that we would not have to pull any cash out at closing. My wife and I agreed to move forward with Chase as we have most of our major accounts with them and have always been happy with the level of service provided. On  XXXX   XXXX  we received the request for information to process the loan while  XXXX  said she was sending our request for 4.5 % up to the manager. On  XXXX   XXXX  we submitted all necessary forms and waited.  XXXX  remained in contact with u s ( ab out once per week  ) a bout the progress of the loan and said that she was still waiting on the manager approval for the rate. Approximately  XXXX   XXXX , I received a call from  XXXX  saying that the loan process was complete, but that the rate came back at 5.4 % not 4.5 %.  XXXX  said she assumed it was a mistake and they wrote the numbers wrong. She told me that she would fast track it back to the manager and would call me in a few days.

XXXX  said that we could just put that money right back into the loan without using any of it. I told her that those were not the terms that we had initially discussed and that I was disappointed that she could n't match the 4.5 % we had initially discussed ( and she made seem like that was not going to be a problem ). Then  XXXX  told me that she could get my rate to 4.5 %, but that we would have to immediately pull {$100000.00} cash at closing. I was extremely upset at that point. I initially only asked for a {$30000.00} HELOC, but conceded to {$50000.00} per their advice. Then I am being told that the loan is finalized and I can only get the rate requested if I pull {$100000.00} up front. I told  XXXX  that I was very unhappy, but would speak with my wife. After speaking with my wife, we were both very upset and disappointed with Chase. We have trusted them with our accounts for years and the way that they handled our HELOC process felt very manipulative. We would have been ok with the 5.5 % rate if they were honest and said that that was the bottom line upfront. Instead, they pushed us through the entire process, all the while making it seem like it was going to be one rate, and then at the end added numerous conditions to it. In our minds the only benefit to pulling {$100000.00} was for Chase to inflate their numbers or reach their loan targets. We feel misled and pushed into a product with a higher balance than requested. I called  XXXX  back and told her we were not ok with those terms, and asked if there was a manager I could speak to to voice my concerns. She told me that there was n't anyone in her department I could talk to about this. At that point I told  XXXX  that we would not move forward with  XXXX  for our HELOC. She was surprised and said that she had never had anyone pull out of a loan after it was final. She told me that the person who originated the loan would be in contact with us soon. We never received the follow-up call or spoke to anyone who we could voice our concerns to. As educated consumers, we feel like we were mislead and that  XXXX  attempted to manipulate us in order to increase their bottom line. We are considering now closing all  XXXX  accounts we currently have with them. We expected a level of honesty and professionalism from a bank of this size.

At this point XXXX is the only missing payment, but I had no reason to believe XXXX payment was credited to XXXX, nor reason to believe XXXX was late as the representative from XXXX Loan Care had fully confirmed the payment over the phone.

I have tried to resolve this issue with XXXX Loan Care and through my mortgage company, who employs XXXX Loan Care to process their payments. I have contacted 3 different people at XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a half dozen different reps at Loan Care. Neither company has made any attempt at actual resolution. 

I am trying to be responsible. I pay all of my bills on time- there is no reason why I would intentionally not pay my mortgage. The money is sitting in my bank account. The only reason I was late at all was because I was told to use the incorrect information to process my payment, and then not notified in a timely manner when it did n't work. The information Loan Care has reported to the credit bureaus is incorrect, and will reduce my credit rating for years to come ( currently, it 's cost me XXXX points on my credit score ). I 'm a XXXX year old XXXX, I do n't deserve to have my credit ruined because of the lazy, deplorable service of my mortgage company and its payment center.",Mortgage

I asked for the audit because of recent events and because I can not see on any statement how interest is applied to my account. I can see an interest rate and simply that there is interest being applied for each loan. When I asked for an amortization calendar, they refused to provide it and gave me a calculation to show how interest should be applied. What is so infuriating is that I know that any other type of loan would show me specifically how interest is applied month over month ( mortgage, credit card, auto loan, etc ). What makes it okay to take advantage of young people coming out of college? 

An additional concern is that in the past I could apply extra funds in my payments to specific loans within my account. This is n't the case anymore. Whatever lump sum i pay in addition to my bill is distributed by them, so I literally have no idea how that money is applied. They say it 's applied to fees first, then interest, then principle. They have never provided a statement of those payments after I made them though, so it is unknown how much is being paid where and if I 'm paying future interest charges or if I 'm taking care of my principle.

XX/XX/XXXX, which appears to have been premature and unwarranted in nature. 

XXXX being aware having been informed after I contacted their billing dept., to dispute and discuss bizarre erroneous monthly charges and ongoing claim denials that began to occur, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Sr. System Analyst ) with XXXX at : ( XXXX ) XXXX on or about ... XX/XX/XXXX waived monthly billings in the amount of {$540.00} after XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX began to initiate bizarre claims processing patterns of ... declining-accepting-declined, to accepting and ultimately declined the claim for me to pay the deductible ( s ) re XXXX that had been stolen the night of purchase. 

This compelled me to file a consumer complaint with the Public Utilities Commission ( PUC )  investigated by XXXX XXXX XXXX, after XXXX months it was determined that ( PUC ) did not have legal jurisdiction and referred the matter to the CA. Dept. of Insurance ( CDI ) which was subsequently filed and is currently being reviewed by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( CDI XXXX as of ... XX/XX/XXXX and pending a conflict of resolution and findings with this dispute. 

At any rate, XXXX appeared to submit this account into collections prematurely with a total disregard, willingly and knowing that it was pending a review, investigation & resolution status, thereby, being unfair exercising unscrupulous & unprofessional tactics. 

Therefore, XXXX should correct by acknowledging and continue honoring XXXX XXXX XXXX ( SCC ) decision in waiving what was considered erroneous & unwarranted monthly billings being processed since cell phones had been stolen, never used resulting from XXXX sales representative ( XXXX ) failure to clearly communicate phones had been activated, in addition to not knowing XXXX   failure by providing the consumer [ after-the-fact ] insurance policy & procedure strikes me being extremely odd & peculiar when claims filed to replace the phone ( s ) by paying the required and agreed {$200.00} deductible are [ null and void ] resulting from ... 1non usage or 2no air time being established prior phones being lost, stolen or damaged. 

This claim/policy information is key & relevant and should have been revealed from the outset to avoid recurrences with unwitting consumers from being victimized through no fault of their own and furthermore, would remedy what appears to be a quagmire loophole if the consumer doesnt get the policy or knowledge thereof prior the claim incident occurring, therefore, XXXX being aware, not an isolated incident needs to modify or revise by stipulating a remedy to address this disconnect of information leading to unethical & unfair practices equivalent to ... [ cramming ], then submitting for collections for erroneous monthly billings that lacks merit which in effect negatively impacts consumers credit report and rating. 

After XXXX most recent consumer settlement re : Penalties to Settle FTC Charges It Violated Fair Credit Reporting Act & FCPB, you would think this would have been a watershed moment, and yet, failure to [ disclose and/or omissions ] of this insurance policy claim provision are the legal basis & merits that gives legitimacy and substantiates the repetitive-patterns of practices with XXXX   in this complaint. 

If I can be of further assistance feel free to contact me, all ( PUC & CDI ) data ( available upon request ).

847376,"Good day, My situation stands as such. I invest heavily in cryptocurrencies through an exchange called XXXX, owned by a U.S. based company called Coinbase, located in XXXX XXXX California. In early XX/XX/XXXX, Coinbase froze my investment account with all of my funds still in it. They did not offer a reason nor contact me in any way regarding this issue. When I attempted to log into my account I was told to contact Coinbase customer support. I immediately did so and was told that my account was frozen "" pending review from a specialist ''. 

It has now been over 30 days since my account has been locked. I am unable to trade, I have no way of knowing if my funds are, in fact, still in my account and despite having called and emailed Coinbase on several occasion I have been given no time frame and still no reason why my account was frozen to begin with. Their answers have been incredibly generic and always basically repeats the same message, that a specialist is reviewing my account and I will be contacted when they have completed their review. 

My goal in filing this complaint is twofold. First, I'm looking to have Coinbase give me back my account ( which I will promptly close, transferring my funds to a safer exchange ), and second I would like to know if what they did was legal. Is it legal for a trading platform to hold a person 's capital for over 30 days without giving any clear reason as to why?

With this being the case, they should not have paid the charge when posted to my account. On XXXX XXXX, 2017 I left for a 7-day vacation out of the country and was not aware that a charge posted to my account that same day, causing the account to become overdrawn by {$9.00}. It was not until I returned home from vacation late in the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, that I learned that my account had been overdrawn and an overdraft fee of {$36.00} was assessed along with several daily fees of {$7.00} ( per day ). I attempted to contact PNC that very evening, but could not reach a live representative, as their offices were closed. On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXXI again placed a call to explain my extenuating circumstances and request a fee reversal. I was told at that time someone from the Escalation Department would have to get back to me on Monday. I agreed and provided my contact information, despite my concerns of compounding fees over the weekend. I received a return call late in the afternoon on Monday, XX/XX/XXXXwhereby the manager ( insert name ) informed me that the fees could not be reversed. This was abruptly communicated without regard to the fact that I am a long-standing customer of PNC and have my mortgage as well as a checking account through them. After speaking with said manager, I decided to call PNC once more to make another attempt. Surely they could make an exception given the minimal amount the account was overdrawn, outrageous fees now being assessed and the fact that this was a rare occurrence. I was again denied any leniency. On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to go to my local branch at XXXX XXXX to speak with the Branch Manager ( XXXX XXXX ) to see if there was anything he could do on his end. After spending close to an hour at the branch, XXXX had a banking associate XXXX craft an email to the regional manager to see if something could be done. XXXX  assured me that he would get back to me with an update by close of business. I did not hear back from him that day, nor the following ( Wed ). MORE FEES ASSESSED! On the morning of Thursday,XX/XX/XXXX, I placed a follow-up call to speak to XXXX and was told he would not be in the office until XXXX XXXX. I left my phone number along with a request for him to call me back. As it neared XXXX XXXX and I did not receive a return call, I decided to contact the branch once more. Someone answered, I requested to speak to XXXX and was placed on hold for 29 minutes. I hung up and immidiately called the branch back and was again placed on hold. It was during which time that I coincidentally received an email from XXXX. XXXX then answers the phone and apologizes. After voicing my frustrations, XXXX assures me that he would place a follow-up with the regional manager and get back to me on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX.

She promptly pulled up the account on her computer screen and even pointed out the initial deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. Reported to me that it was open in credit status only because there were notes for pending research on fees that were supposed to be reversed over 5 years ago. She then, despite my verbal opposition and the court order in front of her, insisted that she had to close the account because I was getting divorced and should not have a joint account with my spouse and that we were no longer eligible for any applicable credits. She then assured me I would have the requested statements within 2 weeks ( records over 7 years old require the processing of a research fee-despite my physically viewing the XX/XX/XXXX Statement on XXXX XXXX 's Screen ). She then informed me that it would cost about {$180.00} in fees and that I would have to come into the branch and pay that when I pick of the Statements, implied to be just after XX/XX/XXXX.

I would also like to reiterate that XXXX XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was extraordinarily helpful and I believe sincerely tried to reverse the deletion and obtain the records for me going back 7 years.

Transparency and customer access to records physically shown to me in person XXXX month ago ( XXXX literally pointed out the opening deposit on XX/XX/XXXX ) is not asking anything out of line when complying with a court order.

981854,"This complaint is centered around the practice of forcing me ( student loan borrowe ) into forbearance for a longer time period than necessary when I was recertifying my income for income based repayment programs. 

In XXXX XXXX, my payment due skyrocketed from the normal {$670.00} REPAYE payment, to a standard payment of principal and interest of over {$3300.00}. I was told that I failed to recertify my REPAYE. I believed that was false, as I contend that I had already recertified and in fact my payment under the REPAYE program increased in XXXX XXXX after I recertified in XXXX XXXX. XXXX denied any knowledge/record of a recertification in XXXX and said that I must recertify ( again ). Having no other option, I began the process. As is the standard practice during the period of recertification, I understood that my loans would briefly go into forbearance. However, I asked, and it was notated on my account, that the forbearance be for the shortest possible time period. I asked that as soon as my recertification was approved, my REPAYE resume. 

I submitted recertification, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email that XXXX received my submission for the recertification of my plan. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email from XXXX notifying me that my REPAYE recertification was approved. 

I expected to be taken out of forbearance in XXXX. In fact, I have a letter dated XXXX XXXX indicating my forbearance began XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and ended XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. However, I received a letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX saying that my first REPAYE payment was due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, meaning I was going to remain in forbearance for the entire month of XXXX XXXX. 

I called to discuss that with a representative because I saw no reason and had no desire to remain in forbearance for the month of XXXX. My recertification was approved and I should have begun paying the REPAYE amount in XXXX not XXXX. The representative tried to help me but was told by a supervisor that it is XXXX XXXX  policy to keep a borrower in forbearance up to 60 days when recertifying. I argued that my recertification was approved and this tactic was improper. No help was offered. The result, of course, was that capitalized interest was added to my account for both XXXX and XXXX XXXX. My argument is that adding capitalized interest for the month of XXXX while forcing me to remain in forbearance was an abusive tactic and a way for XXXX to churn fees and deceive borrowers. The total interest added to my loans for the forbearance period of XXXX and XXXX is not insignificant - it amounted to {$6400.00}. In two months time, by no fault of my own, my loan balance increased by {$6400.00}. It 's unfathomable.

So, it appears that there was a total bait-and-switch scheme conducted here by Navient. To make matters even worse, when I called Navient earlier this morning, the first rep rudely told me that there was nothing that could be done to help rectify this situation, and that I needed to start making my monthly payments on XXXX XXXX, XXXX as instructed. 

I then asked to speak to a supervisor because none of this made any sense to me, and the supervisor told me that I should apply for a loan consolidation which would put a temporary hold on my payments, but after reading the terms and conditions I realized it would essentially reset my loans and I would then have to continue paying off my consolidated loans for the next 360 months. So in summary, in order for me to get a temporary hold on my account, I would have to pay thousands and thousands of dollars of interest over the course of the next XXXX years. Anyone can see that this is just another bait-and-switch by Navient at my expense. 

This situation has not only cost me time and money while providing me with absolutely none of the relief that I was seeking or promised when I initially called, it has also caused me and my family significant emotional distress as we are being made to feel that we are nothing more than debt slaves to Navient, and that my only option is to be beholden to Navient financially for the rest of my life.",Student loan

610049,"I recently submitted a complaint against Ally Bank and this complaint has a lot to do with the first XXXX. 

In my previous complaint, I mentioned a conversation with a customer service representative named XXXX. Before that conversation with XXXX ended, I asked her if she could tell me the principle amount that was left on my auto loan. She could not find that information and transferred me to a customer service agent that could. Her name was XXXX and she refused to tell me what that principle amount that was left was! I explained to XXXX that it 's a simple interest loan which means that there is a finance charge that is tacked onto the principle amount. She said that the principle amount was {$14000.00}. I said that was the total amount left on the loan and again asked her what the principle amount was. She said that the {$14000.00} was the outstanding balance on the account as well. She would not answer my question and that was also very concerning for me. Ally wo n't tell me what the principle amount is, because if I pay that amount off first, they will lose out on the interest amount! XXXX said she would mail a letter explaining the loan ... it should be available on my online account but currently is not! 
I called Ally back, XXXX XXXX, 2016, at XXXX XXXX time XXXX I spoke to a representative by the name of XXXX. I asked him the same question regarding the principle amount remaining on my loan. He did n't have the answer and put me on hold and said that he would transfer me to someone who could answer that question. I was on hold for about 10 minutes before Ally disconnected the phone call. It appears that they do n't want me to know the principle amount owed because it is less than the {$14000.00} outstanding balance. And with a simple interest loan, if I pay the principle off first, Ally loses out on the interest. I know that there is a 6.74 % interest rate included in that outstanding balance. 
At that point, I was frustrated with Ally because here I am trying to work with them and it appears that they are trying to pull a fast XXXX on me. 
I need your help in resolving this issue. Ally was already found guilty of charging higher interest rates on minorities- which I happen to be- who applied for an auto loan and this is headed directly down that path. A simple breakdown on my loan is all that I 'm asking for. How much of the {$14000.00} is the principle amount? It can not be the principle and outstanding balance. The finance company for the last vehicle I bought, broke the loan down completely. The amount of the car, the interest rate, and the total dollar amount of the interest over the XXXX period.

905922,"This complaint is being filed against Bank of America for their HELOC conversion to a 15-year repayment period against a requested 30-year repayment. INTRODUCTION My wife and myself are homeowners in XXXX XXXX, California. We have a {$400000.00} Home Equity Line of Credit from XX/XX/XXXX with Bank of America that is due in XX/XX/XXXX. HELOC GOES INTO REPAYMENT We had received a notice from the bank before this HELOC was to go into a repayment period about our options to either apply for a new HELOC, make no changes and move into the scheduled repayment period or to pay the balance in full. Contacting the bank by phone more or less confirmed these options. Bank of Americas representative stated that if I do nothing the HELOC would go into a repayment period that would increase my monthly payment from approximately {$1000.00} ( interest only ) to {$3100.00} ( principal + interest ) or thereabouts depending on the prevailing interest rate. She further explained that it would be a principal + interest payment amortized over 15 years. I asked if it was possible to amortize the amount over 30 years, as this would reduce my monthly payments. The representative said that in this case I would need to apply for a new loan. NEW LOAN APPLICATION So in XX/XX/XXXX I applied to Bank of America for a 30-year home mortgage loan for {$400000.00}. The Bank of America representative taking my application over the phone understood that this loan if approved would go to pay off the existing HELOC. I was told my monthly payments in this case would be {$1800.00}. I went through their entire loan application process submitting various documents and answering their questions over the phone. Last week on XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed over the phone that my application was denied due to excess debt over income. CONFUSION As a customer I was not able to understand how Bank of America remained confident of being paid {$3200.00} a month from a customer but denied that the same customer would be unable to pay {$1800.00} per month. While discussing this last week with the banks representative I reiterated that they examined all that paperwork on my financial background for a loan amount in which my monthly debt payment to them would be {$1800.00} but they did not conduct a single iota of investigation to determine whether I was financially able to pay a monthly amount equivalent to double that dollar amount. GRIEVANCE I am aware that the bank has signed paperwork from us about the loan repayment period of 180 months. In the Agreement dated XX/XX/XXXX it is stated, The length of the Repayment Period is one hundred and eighty ( 180 ) months depending on the repayment schedule set forth below. You agree that we may renew or extend the period during which you may obtain credit advances or make payments. What I am grieved, hurt and further confused about is in summary the following : 1. Bank of America assumes the risk of a customer to pay {$3200.00} a month on their loan but ignores the lower risk of the same customer paying {$1800.00} a month. 2. Bank of America diligently collects, examines and analyzes documents supporting the financial condition of a customer in weighing the risk of a monthly amount of debt repayment but does not follow the same procedures in weighing the risk of almost double that amount. 3. Bank of America assumes that 11-year old customer financials are sufficient guarantee to ensure a monthly payment of {$3200.00} yet ignores the dependability of a $ XXXX monthly payment against it. 4. Bank of America despite stating in the Agreement that they may extend the period during which a customer may make payments, fails to bring this up as an option. 5. I will be XXXX years of age if alive after 30 years, a fact the number crunchers of Bank of America must have taken into account to analyze risk, as compared to my age of XXXX years after 15 years. Yet what makes Bank of America so sure I will be alive next year? IN SUPPORT My wife and myself have lived in this residence for 29 years and been a Bank of America customer valued according to the bank for 20 years.

122907,"From XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, I was experiencing some serious fraudulent activity in many aspects of my life. My credit rating was always of great importance. As I am an XXXX XXXX XXXX single mother of XXXX. I always maintain good credit, lived very modestly, worked my 9 moth trial work period in hopes of returning back to work. Saved tax returns, paychecks, fund given to me by friends, my sons paychecks etc. While this was all stolen along with XXXX payments, I recently ordered my credit reports in an attempt to get back on my feet. In addition to my children I now have my aging mother. I received XXXX of the XXXX reports after months or trying to get them. After received, there are several accounts that do not belong to me and that should not be on my report. On Trans Union it is incomprehensible how they could take off ALL of my good credit and replace it with bogus phony accounts. They have incorrect addresses and telephone numbers and there were eve incorrect employers. I have yet to receive XXXX despite it to has been ordered several times in the past few months. Someone is responsible for this and it is not me. I wish they would have enough decency to correct the wrong that has been done. This is just plain out cruel. Between XXXX XXXX XXXX stealing my money right from my checking account of 13 years that has had the same transaction pattern up until XX/XX/XXXX when they started stealing large sums of money, to mortgages I definitely qualified for being denied at the last second and now my credit reports are all reporting negative accounts that do not belong to me. Evidently, I have a copy of previous reports. Whomever is responsible for this and whatever their goal was can please kindly return my status on everything back tot he way it was. I am desperately trying to fight against being XXXX and return back to a productive person in society. Between my XXXX and XXXX issues that have come up due to all of this for so long, it is far more difficult that you can imagine. The credit bureaus need to delete the inaccurate accounts immediately and resubmit a copy. I have my aging mother here as well as children. Whatever these peoples goals are I will never know. All I know is do not deserve to have had everything in my life turned upside down. The government agencies do nothing and it is my belief they are the ones to be held responsible. I was hoping someone there had enough integrity to resolve this. However, it starts at the top and trickles down. There are no whistle blowers, they are to afraid. The OIG does nothing to help, they just try to prove legitimately XXXX people of fraud. Keep in mind I worked for many years prior to being forced to collect XXXX. Perhaps I would be able to become stable if the powers that be would cease messing everything up. My credit is very important to me as where the XXXX payments I never received and no one will even take a look at despite having the hard copy evidence. XXXX XXXX XXXX stole my money and I have statements from XXXX and then statements from XXXX to prove it. I do not file complaints unless I have proof and I do. My credit need to return back to the way it was, the bogus accounts need to please be removed. I need to be able to move forward in hopes of getting myself back together enough to work. If XXXX thought for some reason it was a good idea to target me, it was not. I was one that was seriously trying and following the rules. Following the rules got me nothing but sicker. Hopefully we can remedy this. PLEASE RETURN MY CREDIT REPORTS TO THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE. THIS COMPLAINING AND REPORTING AND WRITING LETTERS IS NOT BENEFICIAL TO MY HEALTH.

722993,"Attempted to apply online for an XXXX Visa Signature Card after receiving an offer through the mail for an XXXX Visa Signature Card with a XXXX Mileage Plan sign-up bonus. I searched online and found the same offer but with a {$100.00} statement credit. I applied and was notified that I was approved. However, in the fine print, it stated that since I was actually approved with only a {$2000.00} credit limit this would mean that I would receive a Platinum Plus account. NOT the card that I applied for and this card does not offer the signup bonus that prompted my application. 

I called their customer support number and they said that they could request for my credit line to be increased to {$5000.00} and then switch my card to the Signature Card but even if they did so I would not be able to receive the advertised XXXX sign up offer because it has to be approved at {$5000.00} initially in order to receive the bonus.

I then decided to apply a second time but this time using the credit card offer that I received in the mail ( also for XXXX bonus miles ).

I called their customer support number again and they said that they could merge the XXXX {$2000.00} accounts and then I would have XXXX {$4000.00}. At that point, they could seek an increase of an additional {$1000.00} to get me to a Visa Signature Card and request to honor the XXXX sign up bonus. After remaining on hold for some time, the agent said that they had canceled XXXX of the {$2000.00} and I now had a {$4000.00} Platinum Plus card ( not a Visa Signature ). He then informed me that the bank 's policy did not allow a credit line increase within the first 90 days so I would still be unable to get the card that I actually applied for. Since they were not able to give me the card that I wanted, I was forced to cancel both new accounts. I was NEVER applying ( at least willingly or knowingly ) for the Platinum Plus cards. 

This negatively impacts my credit report as I now have XXXX hard pulls on my credit report and XXXX closed accounts that will now affect my average age of credit history ( XXXX accounts for no reason will bring down my average age of credit overall ).

I have spent hours calling each corporation and being transferred and told at the end they ca n't help me until it is sent to a mysterious department that I can not speak to directly. The way they have the system set up both companies have to be on a conference call both looking at there seperate screens to see that the money is lost in cyperland. So to be clear I was wired XXXX to western union and when I tried to transfer the money to my wunetspend card it was credited and than voided within XXXX seconds by western union.

I recently requested copies of all loan mod denial letters and were sent to me. The XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I have their copy and my original copy. Theirs says "" you are not eligible for loan mod '' .The original XXXX states "" you do not meet the basic eligibility rules, and they did not even review any of the paperwork ''. The paperwork that has been faxed to them for years and hundreds of copies, XXXX times per loan mod request. All the other denials mailed to me said "" they did not receive requested documents ''. Which is a total lie. The Judge also ordered my income to be added to my father 's income for the loan mod request that was denied XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Throughout this 4 year period I have many names on BOA paperwork sent to me that I believe DO NOT EXIST. They were all left many messages and never received XXXX reply. Names will be submitted via fax with other paperwork. If this loan mod request was approved on the XXXX time when my father was making $ XXXX a year or more, then it would have been modified to 2 % -4 % and all would have been done. But instead they kept denying the mod request due to it was not my father 's primary residence. That is not an acceptable denial reason, as I stated before they do exist.

XXXX also stated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that the loan modification was completed but too expensive so it was denied. Then she told me it was sent to upper management to review. Strangely, the very next day a package of a loan mod was sent. I asked her worse case scenario and she stated "" short sale '', or sign over the dead WHEN EVER I WANT ''. Now I do not believe such a statement. I plan on calling her on my day off on Weds XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and recording all her answers. The mod they sent was for a total of $ XXXX or more at a rate of 5.87 %, which was the original percent. The amount owed before this was $ XXXX. They said this was due to my father 's credit score, which of course would not be good with a foreclosure over his head for 4 years. It should be 2 % and should have been done within 30-90 days after applying the first time in XXXX. They continued to deny and deny until all the $ XXXX in equity was eaten up.

The  "" Summons '' and "" Complaint '' t urn out to be fake. There is no court number and no court date.     The fact they tried to scare me with that "" summons '' overshadowed the rights notice that they included and left me thinking I had no rights. Any reasonable person would interpret that they are not still able to dispute the debt. Intentionally doing that is a clear and actionable violation of Section 1692g of the FDCPA.     This is the first communication that I have ever received fr om Messerli & Kramer o n this debt.     Last month on  XXXX   XXXX ,    2017 I ha d sent  XXXX   XXXX   ( the original creditor )  a request for verification, validation and documentation of the account they claimed that I owed them. I did not hear back, but instead they - exactly 30 days later - ha d Messerli & Kramer sue  me with these un-registered papers.         The basis for the claim  Messerli & Kramer a s well as  XXXX   XXXX  is lodging against me in this action is flat out wrong based on REPEATED ignored requests of validation made by me ( through original signature on contract originating a contractual relationship with  XXXX   XXXX  as well a through a full and complete accounting of every transaction, balance and payment applied from  XXXX  to date as well as a comprehensive breakdown of what portion of the alleged debt is principal, interest, fees and when the fees were charged and what the fees consist of ).

FURTHERMORE, there is no basis whatsoever for the claim of  XXXX   XXXX  that I have an account with  XXXX   XXXX  with an account number  XXXX  - as credit account numbers are numerical. This intential misrepresentation of the claimed account is actionable as a direct violation of my consumer rights.     I deny the second claim that I am in default for failing to make the required payments on the charge account as - again - your  XXXX   XXXX  had repeatedly failed to provide validation and documentation of such upon repeated request by me.     Additionally, I have some concerns about the fact that the "" summons '' sent to me was clearly robo-signed. This would lead someone reasonable to believe that this was not written by  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  as the robo-sign says, but instead, from my vantage point, someone practicing law without a license.     I have some concerns about the way in which  Messerli & Kramer handled Dunning me  and that the notice concerning my rights is clearly OVERSHADOWED by the 'summons '' that they have served upon me. Any reasonable person would interpret that they are not still able to dispute the debt. That is a clear and actionable violation of Section 1692g of the FDCPA as well as a potential ethics violation as well.     Additionally, the "" summons '' FAILED to disclose Plantiff 's costs and disbursements, per diem or any other readily available structured fees. I find this ethically questionable as those fees could be anything and if hidden, cause a reasonable person to not seek representation out of ignorance of the potential additional liability.       I want Messerli & Kramer to face consequences for how they handled this whole situation and that they drop the situation as the claim has not any merit and should not be pursued.
As I was interested in finding an amicable solution to this issue, was open to reasonable settlement proposals from Messerli & Kramer   that will equitably settle this situation for both  XXXX   XXXX  and I in which  XXXX   XXXX  will no longer assert claim against me and in which I will not pursue claim agains t BOTH Messerli & Kramer  AND  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX .

they served me with a summons after the date that they said i had to respond. i had tried calling a month prior when i received their first threatening letter but no one answered so i just sent a money order. i was not sure who the debtor was. the complaint stated i did not attempt to pay the debit which is a lie. also it was forcing me to sign the complaint and said i had no objection. when talking with the person on the phone, i did state that i was not even sure who the creditor was and they finally told me after a few minutes. i made payment arrangements and they sent a further stipulation agreement to which i felt compelled to sign but under duress. point though is if this company had worked with me in the first place, this all would not have happened. and on my credit report, they say i am like three years behind in payment ... another lie. i have been sending money orders all along. i am not even sure if this is the right balance. sorry for not capitalizing my letters, my computer messes up when i do. thank you for your time and consideration.",Debt collection

After that initial call in XX/XX/XXXX I went online, created an account and set it up on AutoPay again to start drafting in XX/XX/XXXX, all is well, or so I thought.

I called again on a Friday, and spoke with a different representative who said that she could see where they modified my rate and that no notification was given.

716802,"I am the victim of a fraud. The scheme is as follows. I was contacted by someone from XXXX with a request to take care of a pet. The person sent me a check, which I deposited in my Bank of America checking account. Once the check cleared, I deposited the amount into another Bank of America account as instructed by the fraudster ( minus my fee for the services ). As I was suspicious of this, I waited until the check cleared ( on the very next day ) before I deposited the cash ( minus the advance payment for the services I provided ) to a fictitious pet store for food and other pet care. 
Here are the details : On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received a check for {$2900.00} and I deposited it the same day at the local Bank of America branch in XXXX XXXX, CA. The check cleared the next day ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) and I withdrew {$2600.00} and deposited that amount to another Bank of America bank account. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 the check for {$2900.00} bounced back and the same amount of money was withdrawn from my account. I called the bank ( spoke to XXXX XXXX ) and they told me to contact the fraud department. I asked the fraud department why the fraudulent check cleared the next day, while other checks take at least a couple of days to clear. She said the reason was I had been a loyal customer and had been given access to the money prior to the clearance of the check. I think this is misleading as I would have never withdrawn the money before the check cleared. As a result, I became the victim of a fraud and I 'm questioning the bank 's policies regarding clearing checks. I was told during numerous discussions with the Fraud department that the bank 's policy is to allow customers to use uncleared funds if their accounts are in good standing ; however, the policy appears to not be applied consistently as it was only applied once, for the fraudulent check I received. All checks I have deposited so far have taken more than XXXX days to clear. The policy was only applied to XXXX check which turned out to be fraudulent and the funds were deposited into another Bank of America account. The bank did not provide information regarding where the funds went or tried to do anything about it considering the money was deposited into another Bank of America account. 
In conclusion, I believe that Bank of America 's policies and procedures have caused a loss for the amount of {$2600.00}. With my limited income and as a new immigrant, this is causing me and my family an unbearable financial burden and I 'm unable to pay my rent. 
As I have exhausted all other options for resolution, I am writing to you and hoping you could help me understand why the bank 's policies are applied inconsistently.

I called Ally bank, who I 've had little to no issues with up to this point, my current bank with my current debit card. 

Ally explained to me that the payment was used with my debit card information and that I would have to cancel my card, which I did, and request a new one. They also told me to contact the company that my debit card was used for with this large purchase to see if they could halt payment, as though that 's the consumer 's job, because they could n't stop payment themselves even though it 's pending. I do n't believe that. They also claimed they could not do anything unless the payment went through, and if it did, I 'd have to file some paperwork and wait UP TO 45 - 90 DAYS to get my money back. 

Frankly this is unacceptable. I have never spent more than {$300.00} - XXXX in XXXX purchase, and they are aware of this. I was XXXX in the hospital last week when the purchase was made, so I could not have flown across the country and used my card in California.

81308,"BACKGROUND HISTORY Both my husband and I are educated, intelligent, hard-working taxpayers that 's been dealing with uncontrollable financial hardships and critical health issues over the past six years. We have XXXX boys ages XXXX and XXXX and a sweet little XXXX named XXXX. Our incomes combined started at $ XXXX ( in XXXX ) and continued on a decline to $ XXXX ( in XXXX ) since I 'm the only one working due to my husband 's XXXX. My husband was XXXX six years ago that has now affected his ability to work. We do not have excessive debt, nor mishandling of our income, just a shortage of income. Both my husband and I have XXXX. With our XXXX, we faced our problems, made contact with all our creditors and always provided a firm promise to pay and notification in advance if we could n't keep a scheduled payment. Throughout the last six years we 've endured several layoffs, wiped out savings, no cushion for rainy days, young children in daycare, numerous hospital bills, expensive medicine, and car payments. Well our financial situation has not increased BUT are expenses have decreased ( no daycare, car payments, expensive medicine ) but we 're still dealing with arrears. 
THE ISSUE Our mortgage company is Wells Fargo and they have always worked with us and even modified our loan in XXXX which is the year the decline in my husband 's health affected our ability to pay our bills and cleared our savings. I was laid off in XXXX XXXX, we used my severance, our tax refunds, funds withdrawn from my XXXX, and my unemployment income to maintain our monthly expenses. It felt amazing to not only bring our accounts current but to pay EVERYTHING on time again. For six months, we were current. In XXXX we fell behind on the XXXX mortgage payment as our funds ran out and unemployment of {$1800.00} a month could not cover our monthly expenses. Luckily for me I started working at a new XXXX company the last week of XXXX. We immediately started paying the mortgage again in XXXX, but remain one month behind. Our contingency plan, bring our mortgage current when my husband XXXX approval goes through. 
THE PROBLEM On XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX CST I called Wells Fargo to make my XXXX payment as of that day we were 62 days delinquent. The account manager named XXXX XXXX advised I could not make my XXXX payment since Wells Fargo decided since I 've been delinquent for so long they 're going to proceed with foreclosure proceedings. XXXX XXXX told me I had to pay XXXX, XXXX, XXXX payment and all late fees immediately to avoid FC. Said my acceleration letter sent on XXXX had an expiration date of 35 days to bring the account current or work with loss mitigation to see if I have any options. XXXX XXXX also said that I should borrow the total of {$4400.00} from relatives to bring my account current and pay them back in installment payments. XXXX XXXX also conferenced in another representative name XXXX to confirm everything cited. I was beyond baffled cause I live in TEXAS and a borrower has to be 90 DAYS DELINQUENT to refer a loan for FC. I 'm glad I remained calmed but I was extremely worried. I missed an important meeting with my manager and her AVP in which they had to document as missed time since I already taken lunch that day and only employed 62 days. XXXX XXXX transferred me to loss mitigation and that representative XXXX XXXX took my XXXX payment, sent a modification package, and clarified FC proceedings start after 90 days delinquency. After the call I felt horrible and was shaken. I was threatened with FC just so XXXX XXXX could transfer me to loss mitt to get her referral, if applicable. XXXX XXXX violated CFPB. Please let me if there 's any additional steps I need to follow. Thank you for investigating this issue.",Mortgage

The payment was overlooked and we were never contacted by XXXX by letter, email or phone to be able to address the Issue and make the missed payment. We have since learned about the missed payment after hiring Council. Only then did Seterus inform us of the missed payment. We have since rectified the missed payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2600.00}. We also gave Seterus specific instructions in writing on the cashiers check that the money was to go to the XX/XX/XXXX missed payment or was not to be cashed. Seterus refused to abide by the instructions on the check and cashed the check anyway. When ask why, they explained that wasnt the way they did their accounting and the money was placed into a existing Suspense Account. 
In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  notified us by letter that the loan had been purchased and we were to begin making our payments to Seterus in XX/XX/XXXX. We never received any correspondence from Seterus at that time. We didnt receive a new contract to sign so we assumed Seterus had adopted the same contract we had with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We complied with the letter from XXXX and set up an account on the Seterus Website and began making our payments on XX/XX/XXXX even though we hadnt received a statement from Seterus at the time. It wasnt until after we had made XXXX payment, that we received XXXX statement from Seterus. They had Immediately began charging us a late fee and demanded a {$7900.00} payment that was due XX/XX/XXXX. When we contacted them about the amount, their response was that we had missed our  XXXX payment and we also had to reimburse them for the Escrow disbursement of {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. We explained to them at that time, our payment had been made on-line to them on XX/XX/XXXX as we were instructed to do. We also explained that the Escrow payment should have come from our existing Escrow account with XXXX. Those explanations fell on deaf ears. We received our first of three statements for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX showing we owed {$7900.00} for XXXX payment. This statement also included prior activity with Seterus, although we had never done business with before, showing a XXXX payment and XXXX payment of {$2600.00} respectively. The Statement also showed two Tax Disbursement made on XX/XX/XXXX for  {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. Money, we thought, should have come from funds in our Escrow account  with XXXX. After visiting our Tax Assessor about the Issue, the Tax Assessor explained to us that only two payments had been recorded to our account on XX/XX/XXXX. Both being by Seterus. Meaning that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not make our XX/XX/XXXX tax payment and were still in possession of account funds or Seterus was withholding Escrow funds and refusing to tell us and then demanding we pay them for the dispersed funds. Only after a Escrow Account statement showing a {$7800.00} surplus, did Seterus acknowledge the existence of the funds and after request from council, still refused to refund us our money until we had paid them what they said we owed them. Money that was never owed to them in the first place.

Seterus continues to engage in unscrupulous tactics to get us to pay money that is not owed to them. Seterus continually threatens to foreclose on our home every month and continually sends us unsolicited offers for a Loan Modification that we have never requested, wanting to lower our payments by extending our note to forty years. Seterus continues to harm our credit rating by reporting us late on our payments which has caused us unneeded expenses. We are unable to refinance our Mortgage at the present lower interest rate because of this also. They refuse to acknowledge our Attorney and our Accountant, that we have paid hundreds of dollars for, even after Seterus was sent documentation by our CPA verifying their mistake.

We respectfully request your help in rectifying this unfortunate issue as soon as possible so we may be able to go on with our lives without fear of having our home taken from us and our credit continually being ruined.

The company in question, Select Portfolio Services ( SPS ) became the servicing agent for mortgage foreclosure that was filed in XXXX, and they took over servicing in XXXX. It is still being reported by them with a date of original delinquency of XXXX I contacted them to let them know that the date of original delinquency predated my dispute by over 7 years and must be deleted. Their response was essentially that it is the date of their last activity, not the date of original delinquency, that determines when the 7 year period begins to run, and that they will continue to report this delinquency until XXXX in direct violation of the FCRA. I sent them a letter demanding that they delete this entry but as of this date I have gotten no response. 
The loss of the home and other substantial assets, like a pension, a job, etc, were the direct result of the XXXX mortgage debacle. I have already suffered enough loss from that. I believe SOMEBODY has to have some relief for me instead of the banks. 
I contacted the original creditor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to verify that the date of original delinquency is over 7 years. Their verification, which I believe is incorrect and I will further investigate, said the date of original delinquency is XXXX. It is my belief that there were several missed payments before that date. Assuming that to be true, any reference to this debt must be deleted in XXXX of XXXX. SPS has refused to acknowledge this and insists that it may report until XXXX. 

I had a mortgage in place a few days ago, but because of this entry, and the false record of the date of delinquency, the mortgage was declined at the last minute and I was unable to make the purchase. Disputes have been sent to reporting agencies and the response was the same. They believe the date is extended by the date they got the account. 
Another factor is that when the started servicing the loan, it was to be under the terms and conditions agreed to by XXXX. Part of that agreement was that XXXX would take a deed in lieu of foreclosure. SPS refused to do so and cause more damages because of the time it took to finally get the property out of my name. 

My concern is not only for my account. If they are following this procedure on all of their accounts, they are undoubtedly reporting countless accounts in error. This is not a clerical mistake. It is their policy and procedure, and it a clear violation of law. They need to stop, and they need to be sanctioned for each and every violation.

This tool is doing the opposite because is not letting the customer make payments "" on time '' the automatic payment is there to help customers, and it has to be an "" useful tool '' and Wells Fargo ' s system is not doing that. How do they think a customer can reach their total balance on time if they do not let customers pay extra payments other that the minimum amount with this automatic system they have. 

My original debt was {$4900.00} in XXXX was a balance of around {$500.00}, they applied the deferred interest of more of {$1500.00}. When I called The first time to Wells Fargo I did not realize about this issue with their system, worry about this situation I was trying to move this debt into another account due the high interest they also applied 28 %. As always taking care of my finances. But it is when I realized "" why '' the total debt was not paid "" On time '' so the representative admited she could see I was making "" those unsuccessful additional payments '' due to their system and admited it was their fault.

361078,"My husband and I purchased a home in XX/XX/XXXX and got our first mortgage through Wells Fargo and a second with XXXX. Unfortunately, we currently are very much underwater and have to delay retirement and much needed downsizing due to this situation for the foreseeable future. Wells Fargo solicited us in XX/XX/XXXX to do what we thought was a refinance. We did get a lower rate and changed our repayment term, but unbeknownst to us, this now makes us unable to get any kind of gov't assistance ( HAMP ect. ) because they say our mortgage originated after XX/XX/XXXX. If we had known that refinancing back in XX/XX/XXXX would preclude us from any further ( and much better ) gov't help later on, we would never had done the refinance. As I mentioned, the XXXX mortgage representative solicited us on this, so I feel they did this on purpose. I 've asked countless times if something could be done to help us- both companies- XXXX and Chase- and because we do n't have a financial hardship and because of the XX/XX/XXXX thing, they wo n't help us. And the other big point here is when we got the original mortgage, XXXX did a bridge loan because we had n't sold the house we were living in yet. I feel that should n't ever have been allowed, but it was. As a result, we had trouble selling our original house because the real estate market was just beginning to plummet here but we did n't know it yet. So we had XXXX houses ( and mortgages ) for six months back in XX/XX/XXXX putting us into pretty bad financial hardship then. The last point is, the house we are in now is in an area of multifamily homes with illegal renters which has led to a decline in our property values even less than what it should be for our area. You could say it is a somewhat blighted area. This has made matters worse and is a factor in me wanting to get out of here. 

We just feel that even though we unfortunately signed on the dotted line with all of this, we really were victims of mortgage practices that now are not allowed plus the whole idea that we ca n't get any help because we refinanced in XX/XX/XXXX even though we bought the house in XX/XX/XXXX ( which puts us squarely in the place of people who need help and are underwater ) is just outright unfair to me. Also, just because we are hardworking, taxpaying people does n't mean we should n't get some assistance too. My husband is XXXX and would like to retire but he ca n't because we ca n't sell this house. We could just foreclose like everyone else out there, but we would n't do that. However, I am not sure how long we can do this. Even if Chase ( the second XXXX holder ) could turn our mortgage into a personal loan that would be a great option here, but they said no on several occasions. The house is currently worth the first mortgage ( XXXX ) so that could easily be paid off with a sale. The problem is a sale currently would not pay off the second mortgage completely, but Chase wo n't budge on working with us on this. 

Sorry for the lengthy summary, but this has just been such a terrible experience and I do n't know what else to do. I feel these big banks ( ironically XXXX and Chase the XXXX that seemed to survive this whole financial mess really well even though they helped cause it ) have so much money and gov't encouragement to help people, but they really are n't.",Mortgage

I explained the reason was because I did not make my payment late, the evidence being that I have never made a late payment. Additionally, I requested that the Bank close my credit card account effective immediately. 

Next, on XXXX XXXX XXXX I wrote another letter ( mailed same day by USPS priority mail ) repeating the request that the Bank make the balance due on my credit card account zero.

I had heard from the Bank about the fraudulent transaction. In a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the Bank had notified me of suspected fraud in connection with the Membership and had determined I was not liable for any charge arising from the transaction. I explained that the Banks bills ( including the latest dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) continued to be mistaken. This was because, as enumerated in my letters of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, the late payment fees ( now totaling {XXXX} ) and interest charge purchases ( now totaling XXXX ) continued to be in error. Additionally, I explained that, despite the Banks XXXX/XXXX/XXXX letter agreeing with the fraudulence of the transaction, I was continuing to be charged XXXX for the fraudulent transaction. 

Today, on XXXX XXXX XXXX I am writing another letter ( to be mailed by USPS priority mail ) re-repeating the request that the Bank make the balance due on my credit card account zero. I am reminding the Bank that the Banks bills ( including the latest statement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the past due warning dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) continue to be mistaken.

Bottom line, I had zero doctors visits in XXXX and zero medical issues over that period. There is no way I ordered any medical services that could have given rise to any legitimate debt. 

Upon several requests, XXXX has repeatedly refused to provide any specific proof and medical records to validate this alleged collection -- in particular, they have provided no : ( 1 ) details of the contract underlying the alleged amount, ( 2 ) proof that I ordered any medical services, ( 3 ) substance and details of the medical services that are alleged to be ordered, ( 4 ) substance and details of the doctor that ordered any of these alleged medical services, and ( 5 ) substance and details of any medical conditions that would warrant or be associated with the medical services they allege were ordered.
In addition, they have provided no proof the alleged medical services were in fact delivered and received, and that the alleged medical provider in fact performed and completed their duties under the alleged contract. That is a required and critical element of a valid contract -- without that, there is no contract. 

Having possession of some of my personal information does not verify this alleged debt ( e.g. social, address, name ) as that does nothing to substantiate the particulars of their claim. Moreover, i was one of the consumers whose personal information was hacked and compromised by Equifax -- and therefore a higher standard of verification is required.

XXXX is reporting this alleged collection to Equifax in order to wrongly extract payment on a note that it specifically knows, and should reasonably know is unenforceable and is invalid.

So, in my opinion, it does n't make sense that since my score was low, to make it better by raising my utilization. It just seems like a flawed system. Synchrony wanted to offer to run my full credit report again to try and increase the limit back, but I declined that due to the fact that it would impact my score again. The card was originally with XXXX, and ever since it moved to Synchrony, I have been upset with their bank. The worst part is that this is my oldest account, so closing it would drop my score again.

611382,"XXXX XXXX, XXXX To Whom It May Concern at Best Buy/Chase Bank, Please let this letter serve as a formal complaint to both of your entities, the credit reporting bureaus, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the California Department of Consumer Affairs, the XXXX XXXX Department of Consumer Protection, the California Office of the Attorney General, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
Fact # 1 ) I, XXXX XXXX XXXX obtained a Best Buy credit card XX/XX/XXXX. I used that card at that time for a promotion to buy a refrigerator for {$2200.00}. I did so because the promotion offered "" {$0.00} down and 0 interest '' as long as the balance was paid off within 12 months. I did exactly that -- I paid off the purchase within a year and had no problems. There was no monthly interest charge, and there was no monthly minimum payment. 
Fact # 2 ) I did not use that card again until XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a sound system for my home for {$910.00}. I made this purchase based on an advertisement campaign similar to the previous one XX/XX/XXXX ( I have enclosed a copy of a similar advertisement from today which offers 0 % interest on all purchases over {$390.00} AS LONG AS the purchase is paid off within 12 months. ) Nowhere in the promotion did it say that a minimum payment had to be paid each month. I confirmed the details of this promotion both with the manager on duty at the XXXX XXXX XXXX store where I made my purchase, and again with the cashier at check-out. I did this twice because I wanted to be sure, and because I did the exact same thing the first time using my card for a promotion in XX/XX/XXXX. 
FACT # 3 ) Similar to the period from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, I did make sporadic payments over the next year ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) to bring my balance to what should have been a {$0.00} balance by XX/XX/XXXX. Instead, your company immediately after my purchase began charging me interest on my balance. Without my consent, I was accruing interest monthly, directly against the terms of the promotion I agreed to. XX/XX/XXXX I had a balance of {$310.00}, which I paid in full XX/XX/XXXX because I had already received a communication telling me that I was past due for that amount. Please note that I paid {$470.00} in interest and fees that I never agreed to, and were NEVER mentioned in the promotion I agreed to. This was a drastically different experience than the first time I used the card. 
Fact # 4 ) I had planned out my budget for the year, and as evidenced in the attachment below I made payments according to that plan to come to a zero balance by the end of one year term ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. ) Nowhere in the promotion did it say I had to make specific monthly payments, and specifically in my conversation with both the manager on duty AND the cashier I asked if I needed to make a monthly payment -- the answer was always "" no, as long as you pay it off by the end of a year. '' Fact # 5 ) Your company 's incorrect addition of interest and other fees from the time of purchase NOT ONLY erroneously added {$470.00} to my account, but when the balance thus deviated from my plan it caused me to become ( inaccurately ) "" delinquent '' in paying my bill. Again, I asked XXXX separate employees ( XXXX the manager ) if I needed to make scheduled monthly payments and was told "" no. '' And that 's how it had gone the first time I used the card. These inaccurate "" delinquencies '' were then incorrectly reported to the credit bureau. Your erroneous actions in this regard have been extremely detrimental to my credit rating. This has prevented me from obtaining a home loan and other necessary financing for both my business and personal life.

As a result of Care Credit reporting the account to the bureau, my credit score may be negatively affected when I actually never defaulted not was late on a payment.

I believe their interest calculation works in principle according to : 1 ) the interest on any statement refers to the purchase amounts carried over from the previous month. 
2 ) the closing date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and the payment due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) are different, 3 ) the interest rate on amounts carried over from previous months is really high and seems arbitrary as the following data from my credit card statements shows : statement date interest charged balance amount paid ( $ carried over ) XXXX/XXXX/16 {$14.00} {$1400.00} {$1400.00} ( {$0.00} ) XXXX/XXXX/16 {$16.00} {$1400.00} {$1400.00} ( {$63.00} ) XXXX/XXXX/16 {$14.00} {$1100.00} {$1000.00} ( {$120.00} ) XXXX/XXXX/16 {$15.00} {$1000.00} {$1000.00} ( {$29.00} ) XXXX/XXXX/16 {$6.00} {$520.00} {$250.00} ( {$270.00} ) XXXX/XXXX/16 {$12.00} {$1200.00} {$1200.00} ( - {$3.00} ) XXXX/XXXX/16 {$9.00} {$1600.00} {$1000.00} ( {$600.00} ) My monthly payments were all made on or before the payment due date. 

My problem is that I called BoA for clarification - it took over 1/2 hour, multiple holds, speaking with XXXX representatives before getting a rough answer - made by the above XXXX points. Their description on how to avoid interest payments on regular retail purchases seems simple enough - "" Pay the statement in full. '' However, debt carry-over into the next billing period seems arbitrarily exhorbitant, according to my data above, i.e. interest charged vs. ( $ carried over ). BoA does not provide clear rules in this regard. Coupled with calculation uncertainties surrounding the different closure and payment due dates, even the BoA representatives that I spoke to were confused on how interest charges are computed. One representative even commented on possible interest charged on purchases made within the closing and payment due dates - showing up on the next billing statement. As I did not receive a $ -to- $ itemized detail on how BoA obtained the precise interest figures, I conclude BoAs practice of interest computation is nothing short of obsfucation that works in their favor ; and hence predatory. Although the interest payments are not large in this case, I feel BoAs credit card practices deserve closer inspection.",Credit card

200090,"I had XXXX checking accounts with US Bank because XXXX had fraudulent charges so I was in the process of closing it. Before I could a XXXX dollar charge hit the account, which sent it into overdraft status ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I called the bank the same day and stated my above attentions and asked if they would close the account to keep it from being used again and I would in the meantime payoff the {$300.00} I owe. I told the representative the account is in a position I can handle financially, and I do n't want other charges that I may have forgotten to affect the account. She told me to stop all overdraft protection on the account first and that would not allow anything to enter the account and stop overdraft fees. She stated that US Bank does not close overdraft accounts even at the request of the customer. I told her I want to stop all activity and at the time I found she could have offered an payment plan. I also told her that my next pay was in two weeks and I was afraid of anymore fees occurring. Again, I was assured the discontinuation of the overdraft protection. 
Well, the account ended up {$780.00} overdrawn by XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, I was not able to pay the account off because it kept growing and I could not afford such a huge payment with mortgage and other living expenses. So, after two pay periods, the bank took the money from my open account and now that account is overdrawn due to prearranged bills, i.e. car payment, school fees, not including groceries for my child. I remembered what was told to me after this first occurred and I contacted the bank again I asked if they would give me back all those fees, about {$400.00} dollars because I declined overdraft protection and followed the instructions of the representative, and I was refused. She gave me back {$72.00} and told me to have a nice day. 
I was really disappointed with the customer service and the lack of direction so that this could have been avoided. Overdrawing my account is not something I do every week or even every month. I found myself in unknown territory and I feel the bank took advantage of me and allowed the situation to escalate to a point beyond my ability, so they could make an additional {$500.00}. I reached out to them and asked for help when this first happened. Although, the bank manager stated I ignored their messages and I did n't, again, I reached out and followed their instructions. The account was closed and, finally when I reached out to someone higher, I was told because the account is closed no one can make adjustments on closed accounts. I just said, Unbelievable! 
So, I had to ask the question, if I had spoke to someone higher before the branch manager closed the account after they received their money, could an adjustment been made? Yes, the branch manager could have made the larger adjustment also, if they wanted too. Although, she told me she could not. 
This is my complaint, I feel better communication would have prevented this issue. The only one suffering from this is me, a single mom of XXXX, who needs every dime she can get. I feel that nothing will come of this because after all, they are a huge bank with a team of lawyers. I just do n't want anyone else to be in a financial bind because of lack of understanding and knowledge. Thank you for reading my petition and if I am refunded some of my money because of this you have my gratitude.

Over that period of time, I was told by XXXX different tellers on XXXX separate visits that I did not have to continue the recurring transfer, that it only needed to be set up that way initially. They said I could just discontinue the transfer at any time and no fees would result. So I discontinued the recurring transfer in XX/XX/XXXX.

The other day, when logged into the Wells Fargo iPhone app, I noticed a negative balance in this account. Looking further, I found that the account had been emptied by {$5.00} monthly service fees since XX/XX/XXXX. I was shocked and dismayed. I went to the bank at once and spoke with banker XXXX XXXX, who politely listened to my complaint. She called a customer service representative named XXXX ( who reluctantly told me his last name was XXXX ), whom I spoke to on XXXX XXXX 's desk phone. After hearing my story, XXXX XXXX told me that although the tellers had given me erroneous information, which he said could perhaps be classified as "" bad behavior, '' it did n't meet the criteria of "" bank error '' and therefore there was nothing that he could or would do.

I do n't know if the tellers had given me incorrect advice to discontinue the recurring transfer inadvertently, or if they did it specifically to generate fees. It does n't really matter at this point. The fees will total {$70.00}. 
Regardless, this is the sort of predatory activity that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was designed to combat. As a mere customer, there is little that I can say myself that Wells Fargo will listen to. I know their behavior is wrong, they know it, and now you know it.

823295,"I am filing a complaint against Nationstar/Mr. Cooper Mortgage Company due to unacceptable practices that have occurred after I refinanced my home loan. My original mortgage payment ( prior to refinancing ) was around 1k. I refinanced in XX/XX/XXXXand enjoyed a monthly payment of {$850.00} for about 15 months. In XX/XX/XXXX my payment increased back up to {$990.00}. I have since been paying this amount and haven't been able to get acceptable responses from the mortgage company.

As I mentioned, I refinanced my loan inXX/XX/XXXX, but byXX/XX/XXXX my payment increased back up to XXXX and the reason I was told was because my insurance and property taxes have increased. This is not true. I recently researched this and I don't see the increase. My property taxes from XXXX to XXXX have only increased by {$190.00}. Meanwhile my annual insurance premium has remained around {$200.00}. Currently in my mortgage payment {$390.00} is being applied towards escrow. This calculates out to {$4700.00} a year. However my XXXX property tax was only {$2700.00} and my insurance premium was {$180.00}. This only totals {$2900.00} ... for a difference of {$1800.00}. I relayed all this information to Mr. Cooper and received a letter explaining there is a minimum amount balance requirement and that mortgage insurance is also built into the payment. Both factors are reasonable reasons. 

The issue is that all contributing factors that determine escrow remained constant over the life of my loan. I refinanced in XX/XX/XXXX which extended the life of my loan back to 30 years and now the monthly payment amount is right back to where it was before the refinancing. I have responded to Mr. Cooper explaining this and asking for more details. I received another letter stating that 30 days is needed so the loan can be investigated. It is nowXX/XX/XXXX and I still have yet to receive a response.

After absentmindedly missing a payment I paid the full balance the following month, and, on a subsequent login to Navient 's website, the limited information available to me on Navient 's website showed that Navient had allocated the payment nearly equally between principal and interest ( allocation in prior month 's was about 70/30 principal/interest ). The information available to me on Navient 's website did not reflect allocation of payment to any fees. 
I submitted a request through Navient 's website for information regarding Navient 's calculation of the allocation. It took several days to get a response to this inquiry, and Navient 's answer was mere boilerplate - Navient 's answer referred me to the Promissory Note, without indicating specific sections or language, and without providing any analysis applying the terms of the Note to the allocation of payment to interest for my specific loan. Navient 's answer did not state that they had charged any fees. Meanwhile, Navient continues to charge interest. 
Although I submitted a new message through Navient 's online messaging platform, Navient 's messaging platform does not allow borrowers to "" respond '' to communications from Navient, which unnecessarily interrupts the continuity of communications and tends to make it more difficult for borrowers to get answers from Navient and to restore their loans to fully paid-up status ( i.e. to make payments without fear of misallocation ).

14179,"I got a target credit card approval while checking out of a Target store XX/XX/2015. My first bill was {$110.00} which I used the phone payment plan to pay in full on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I did not hear a thing until the next month when they sent me a bill with an additional fee attached. I called and spoke directly with a person calling herself XXXX who told me that the bank refused the payment due to incorrect account number being submitted by the company. It appeared they left out a single zero. I corrected the checking account number error with XXXX who repeated it back to me correctly. I authorized the payment again over the phone. I checked my back account and sure enough the amount I just authorized to be paid to Target was pending on my account. 

Figuring a mistake is a mistake I charged another {$100.00} on the target card. This time I paid on-line, and my payment appeared to be accepted. However the next month I was changed a late fee again and again my payment had been decline due to inaccurate bank account submission. I typed the account number in myself and it was correct. 

I have been charged well over the total amount of my charges for late fees all of which various representatives claimed to have removed. I called and spent a great deal of time of the phone with yet another representative I had and still have names of employees, their ID numbers, dates and even payment confirmation numbers. I walked painfully through my practices which included submitting paper checks after payments by phone, I even have letters from my financial institution verifying each time a payment was declined the amount was in my account however was not released because TARGET submitted the wrong number. 

Please realize that I have a debit card with target that is directly connected to this same account. I had made payments by paper check that indeed when through, I had corrected my account information with XXXX employees. I walked through the math with the last person I spoke to according to both our math I should have had a credit. 

While speaking with the last Target employee I asked my credit card account be closed I have submitted the same request in writing. 

The last employee I was on the phone XX/XX/XXXX my dispute would have to be reviewed by the accounting department. This accounting department was supposed to contact me by phone with in three business days but I work during business hours and requested a message to be left or an e-mail to be sent instead. I was assured I would receive both yet I have received neither. 

I have yet another bill with another balance made up not of fees and charges for non-payment. I am not about to make another payment to this account that should have been closed months ago as it seems the more I pay the more I owe. This crooked company is effecting my credit score which would be good if not for my dealing with Target Red cards unsavory business practices I can not believe any company in business can be this incompetent. I surmise they purposefully submit incorrect bank account numbers to financial institutions for the purpose of holding credit accounts open and charging various fees and interest. Had they gotten my account number correct I would have paid the entire balance of my first change of {$110.00} immediately in XX/XX/XXXX. My XXXX change of {$100.00} would have been paid in full after two billing cycles therefore minimizing the amount of money they would have made on my account. 

Incorrect bank account number submission for payment after multiple corrections over the phone, via the internet, use of paper checks and I even have a Target debit card which takes money out of my bank account just fine is a highly unlikely coincidence and a more than likely shady business practice which should be illegal. I should not be charged for their mistakes.",Credit card
888691,"We are filing this complaint against SPS Servicing for the following reasons and actions : Dual tracking Failure to comply with CFPB regulations regarding : o Appeal rights and processing o Offering all available options for which the homeowner was eligible My husband and I requested a loan modification. We promptly complied with all requests for information including repeated requests for the same information. XXXX XXXX, 2017 We received an offer for a loan modification described as HAMP Tier 1 Trial Modification. The letter describing the modification offer said we were not considered for some other options because SPS found that qualified for that option. I believe we qualify for the loan modification option that includes forgiveness of part of the principle and extending the life of the loan which was referred to as HAMP Tier 2 Trial Modification. What caused us additional concern that we not offered all the options that we are entitled to is there was an option that we did not qualify for and the loan modification offer letter clearly states that. So if we were considered for the HAMP Tier 2 Trial Modification and found to not be eligible for it, why did they not state that instead of stating we werent offered that option because we were eligible for a different option? It also appeared to us that they were attempting to force us to buy insurance from their insurer as we believed the cost of the insurance was more than what normally pay. Included in the offer letter was notification of our right to appeal. ( Copy of loan modification offer letter attached ) XXXX XXXX, 2017 We XXXX a written appeal to them XX/XX/XXXX and it was received by SPS XX/XX/XXXX. The appeal listed and requested among other things proof that we were evaluated for all the modification options for which we are eligible at entitled by law, clarification on the costs of insurance included in the escrow and asking for confirmation that the insurer prices were those of our insurer, disputing their valuation price and method and other items which we were outlined in a letter with was attached to a copy of the loan modification offer documentation. Please note that we indicated that we did want a loan modification but requested all the information entitled to us by law. ( Complete appeal letter with proof of delivery attached ) XXXX XXXX, 2017 We received a letter from SPS dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they had received our inquiry but not referencing it as an appeal, they did not respond definitively to any of the requests outlined in the letter most specifically our question about whether we were eligible for the loan option that included principle forgiveness called the HAMP Tier 2 Trial Modification stating they considered all options but we unable to provide any details on that process which we believe means they did not seriously evaluate us for that option or providing details would have been the best response and may have allowed the trial modification they offered to commence. Further, the letter stated that they offered us the best option but their responsibility by law is to inform of the options we are eligible for. And makes the determination best option? And who is it best for who us or them? Arent they supposed to inform us and/or explain all the options that we are eligible for? That did not happen. Further, they then stated that in order for them to consider our appeal, we had to make the trial modification payments. That is a contradiction in terms. If I am appealing the terms and amount of contract, I cant honor it by making payments because that very act signifies acceptance of the terms and conditions. That letter also included notification of our right to appeal this information which we did. Please note that the XX/XX/XXXXletter did not mention our appeal but instead referenced an inquiry, did not state that the letter was any form of response or decision in regards to the appeal. Additionally, please note that to date, we have not received a decision in regards to our appeal. ( Copy of letter attached ) XXXX XXXX, 2017 We XXXX a 2nd appeal, reiterating our original requests and grounds for appeal which SPS had not responded to. The package was received XXXX XXXX 2017.

That is in violation of the law which says that we are entitled access to all of the loss mitigation options for which we eligible including loan modification under the best program we were eligible and the right to appeal which we were currently engaged in. Please note that to date, we have not received an answer to our question as to whether we were eligible for options other than the one we were offered. XXXX 2017 We found a notice on our door that our property was up for Trustees sale.
To date : We have not received a response our appeal, no notice of denial or no correspondence addressing any of the grounds for appeal. XXXX XXXX, 2017 at XXXX XXXX I spoke on the telephone with XXXX XXXX where we discussed the situation with our property. I informed him that to date we were never informed about the decision regarding appeal, had never receive any information in writing from SPS referencing our appeal most specifically we had never been informed that our appeal had been denied before beginning foreclosure activities which I believe is directly against CFPB regulations regarding fair and honest dealing with homeowners. His response was that the appeal had been denied and when I asked him on what grounds, he informed me that our appeal was not received with the 30 days permitted for response. While on the telephone he confirmed that we had not been mailed an appeal denial letter and offered to mail it that day. I informed him that the grounds of the appeal were not correct as I had proof that we our appeal was submitted in a timely manner and well within the 30 days allowed. The loan modification offer letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX and our appeal was received by SPS XX/XX/XXXX, proof of receipt is attached. The terms of the appeal state that foreclosure activities are suspended pending the appeal and since the appeal was still pending, the listing of home for sale is not allowed. By failing to inform us of an appeal decision, we were denied us the ability to pursue other options in timely basis which leads us to believe were being dual tracked.",Mortgage

489124,"Hello. I am having trouble with student loans which I believed to be under the loan forgiveness repayment plan. I have been making payments for almost 5 yrs and am just now being told that the repayment plan Im in is not compatible with loan forgiveness. 

I had a XXXX and in 2007 went back to school for my XXXX. I was divorced with children and all that entails, and at the time of graduation I had approx. {$100000.00} in federal and approx. {$120000.00} in private loans. I heard about the loan forgiveness program through the XXXX for nurses in qualifying institutions, had my loans consolidated and was told to choose a repayment plan. ln order to ensure that I chose the right repayment plan, I had someone from XXXX on the telephone, guiding me in my choice, to be absolutely sure that I made the right choice. She told me to choose from XXXX payments, XXXX of which was the standard repayment plan-fixed. The others were income contingent, graduated repayment, and extended repayment. She told me that after I had made XXXX payments I could apply for loan forgiveness. During this time my loans have been transferred to different servicers. At no time, until this latest transfer have I been told that I was not in the proper repayment plan. The current servicer has informed me that I am not in the proper plan, that none of my payments so far ( approx. {$50000.00} ) will count toward forgiveness, and that if I now want to be in this plan my payments would increase to $ XXXX. I have no paper trail for the original advice that was given me, as it was via telephone. Was this representative misinformed? Was she a government employee? She worked for the XXXX is all I know. These loans at 7 % have only decreased to approx. {$100000.00} in 5 yrs. though lve paid {$50000.00} I could see this only slight decrease but my thinking was in another 5yrs ( XXXX payments total ) I would have basically paid off the loan anyway and they would really only be forgiving the interest. I am enclosing a couple of relevant documents, XXXX of which says that I am eligible for loan forgiveness, XXXX stating I am not in the proper plan because it is standard -extended. I am also including my original promissory note, pgs XXXX and XXXX which outline the terms and which also state I am in the standard plan, not standard extended as my current servicer insists. My initial payment plan of {$720.00} lines up with the standard plan also. 

My other issue is that the government claims it is helping grads get out of student loan debt, yet the way the 7 % interest is calculated, it is NOT helping those of us who are making our payments every month, on time for years.

Astoria Federal reported this account as charged off in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I paid the principal and interest on this account in full in XX/XX/XXXX. The account was closed and no further advances were ever made. 

FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) requires any party who has furnished information to a CRA to promptly update that reporting as necessary to maintain its current accuracy. Astoria Federal was thus required to update their credit reporting to keep it current and accurate. Astoria Federal failed to update the account status from "" Charge-off '' to "" Paid charge-off '', and omitted my payments from the reported account history. THIS CONSTITUTES A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT. 

( Astoria Federal did update the balance to zero at the time the account was paid. However this is not equivalent to reporting the account as paid as there are many reasons a charged off account could report a zero balance, such as the debt being sold to a collection agency.

I did not receive my repayment terms as they were sent to a temporary address and I was in the process of moving. I contacted the lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XXXX/XXXX/2013 via their messaging system, as suggested in their emails, to inquire about placing my loans into a deferment status ( derogatory reporting had not begun ). The response from the lender was to complete an eligibility quiz on their website, and submit produced form, to which I obliged. In XXXX I retrieved the response, and submitted the form produced after completing the lenders eligibility quiz to the loan deferment department as directed, and assumed my loans were placed in deferment as indicated on the website. 
Two months later I noticed derogatory marks on my credit report and contacted the lender, at which time, due to their mistake, they agreed to backdate my forbearance and "" remove all delinquencies '' from my account. 
The lender has since refused to pass the updated account information along to the credit reporting agencies. I have disputed the delinquencies with the lender, credit reporting agencies, and the ombudsman on several occasions, however, the lender is refusing to update the account information stating because it was accurate "" at one time '', they do not have to remove the derogatory remarks from my account. In addition XXXX stated they were following Dept. of Education guidelines by keeping inaccurate information on my credit report. I have since confirmed with Dept of Education representatives, this is untrue. 
The lender 's failure to report complete and accurate account information is a violation of the FCRA section 623 ( a ). Furthermore on XXXX, I was advised the lender would not report any of my payments while the loan was in deferment status, and advised I put my loans into a repayment status if I wanted my payments to be reported, this is also a violation of the FCRA. 
At the advice of the lender I removed the loans from deferment, and they have since started reporting payments. 
I have since learned that not reporting payments to an account is a violation of the FCRA and requested to have my loans account changes removed. My loans have been placed back into a deferment status, however, they have not reversed any of the compounded interest. 
I filed a compliant with the Ombudsman and was advised on XXXX by representative XXXX XXXX that student loan lenders are required to follow the same regulations as other lenders and directed my to the Title XXXX, however, no where in the Title XXXX does it state that it negates other Federal Regulations, in fact there are several references to compliance with FCRA, therefore the lender is not above government guidelines and must report the retroactive deferment status, and removed delinquencies.

906315,"I am writing in regards to a private loan that is reporting incorrectly on my credit files/reports. On at least one occasion I have disputed the validity of the information being reported for this account and the dispute always comes back as unchanged and the account information being reported has been verified.
The issue was clarified in the 1996 amendments to the FCRA, which set a specific starting date that is now SET BY LAW as the last deliqency date, and not later dates, such as a DOLP.
FCRA Section 605 : ( c ) Running of reporting period. ( 1 ) In general. The 7-year period referred to in paragraphs ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) ** of subsection ( a ) shall begin, with respect to any delinquent account that is placed for collection ( internally or by referral to a third party, whichever is earlier ), charged to profit and loss, or subjected to any similar action, upon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the commencement of the delinquency which immediately preceded the collection activity, charge to profit and loss, or similar action. Late Payments - Seven years from the month in which the late payment was due. If there are multiple late payments in one account item, then they will each expire individually. 
Charge-Offs - Seven years. The time runs from the date of the delinquency, plus 180 days. For example, if a payment was due on an account on XX/XX/XXXX, but the debtor defaulted, and never caught up to become current again, and the account is eventually declared a charge-off by the creditor, then the seven years reporting time limit starts running on XX/XX/XXXX, with the item scheduled to expire from his/her credit reports on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached paperwork directly from the XXXX website that clearly shows the first late on thisaccount occurred on/around XX/XX/XXXX, but my credit files are reporting that there was n't a late on  theaccount until XX/XX/XXXX. This erroneous entry showing an incorrect date of first delinquency is detrimental to my overall credit rating and has caused me severe financial and emotional distress. My question now is how was this investigation conducted to confirm that what is currently being reported is accurate? A template response to my complaint at this point will not be acceptable. This account is not only being in-accurately reported but is also past the reporting limits based on the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Instead of displaying the statement balance ; the minimum payment due ; the current balance ; and the available balance, the prominent information consists only of the the last three items ( plus available cash advance value ).

249399,"This complaint relates the manner in which Barclays Card US applies payments when there are both promotional and non-promotional balances. Per a reading of the terms and conditions on the statement, payments are posted first to the higher interest balances and then the excess to the promotional balances. For the statement ending XXXX/XXXX/2016 I had a promotional balance of {$760.00} ( expiring XXXX/XXXX/16 ) and a non promotional balance of {$600.00}. I sent in a payment of {$670.00} on the due date. The a portion of the payment was correctly applied with {$600.00} against the non-promotional balance, however the excess of {$65.00} was applied against yet unbilled non-promotional balances. Under this application, if a consumer is using the card for purchases during a billing cycle, it becomes nearly impossible to payoff the promotional balance. A reasonable individual would understand and expect that if he pays off the entire non-promotional balance and sends additional funds, that these additional funds would be applied towards the promotional balance. 

Barclay customer service explained that this is not how it is handled as the yet unbilled non-promotional charges COULD be subject to a higher interest rate than the promotional balances, thus they are paid first, to protect the customer. In reality, this does not protect the customer but creates a scenario when the customer 's promotional balances does not decrease over time and the entire promotional balance must be paid in the final two months in order to avoid paying all of the accrued, yet unbilled finance charges associated with the promotional balances. 
While this could be argued is in keeping with the disclosures, it is both morally and ethically deceptive.",Credit card

It is difficult but extremely rewarding work, and I cant imagine doing anything else professionally. 

Like many hopeful young Americans, took out student loans to earn my XXXX degree. And, like many new to the job market in the XXXX, I realized quickly that I would need a XXXX degree if I wanted a job that would allow me to buy a small home and start a family. So, I took out more student loans and went back to school. It seemed the correct choice, as my increased training and credentials open the doors to this job that a love. 

Since the inception of the XXXX Public Service Loan Forgiveness program I have made 120 full, consecutive, on-time payments toward my student loans. During this time **my loanowner has changed multiple times** ( without my consultation ) and Ive had to make sure my previous payments transferred in. This diligence means that this month, XXXX XXXX, I have met the required XXXX consecutive payments and have my loans forgiven! Right? 

Sadly, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is telling me NO. I have been told that the clerical title of my payments -- graduated payments vs income-driven payments -- means the $ 70,000+ dollars Ive paid in those 120 payments dont actually count toward loan forgiveness. In a bitter twist of irony, the payments I was making were actually larger ( an extra {$200.00} a month ) than the qualifying payments would have been. At every step of the way, over these last 10 years, I was told my account was in good status which I ( naively ) understood as meaning that I was making qualifying payments. 

I have taken up my case with Fedloan, the current holder of my student loans. It took them months to review my case, and in the end they told me sorry, but youll have to start your 10 years of payments over again. This would add another $ 60,000+ to the price of an already costly education! This was not an acceptable answer, so I turned to the same government that was so willing to lend me this money. 

When I presented this information to my local Congressman XXXX XXXX office, his representative showed empathy, but little interest in assisting me beyond a general inquiry. I then contacted XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  directly with a manager, and after another case review, I was told the following : This seems wrong, but its a big system and these kind of things happen. And, Unless we find that something illegal has taken place, we are powerless to act on your account. 

Is it not illegal to be charged twice for the same education? I make an XXXX XXXX salary, and for the last 9 years this has been a huge hit to our monthly income. Between my loan payments, and some very serious medical bills, weve had to refinance our home twice to cover debt accrued over the years. Making this 120th payment was supposed to be a life-changer for my family. 

I have been steadfast in both my monthly loan payments, and my service to the community. I have made large payments, in full, and on time, for more than a decade. I even made a {$10000.00} payment at the advisement of my loan holder to show good faith the first month that the Federal Loan Forgiveness program started. 

I am not asking for a free ride. I am a person who pays his bills ( my near XXXX credit score will back this claim ). I have been making my payments, and serving my community for well over a decade.

Instead of switching me to IBR with an income of {$0.00}, they switched me over to IBR based on my income when I had a job. 

To compound this problem, they only notified me that they put me in the wrong IBR on Saturday morning, do n't answer the phone over the weekend, and took the money out of my account on autopay before my credit union had even opened this week. 

When I called them yesterday to complain, they said they could suspend my payments for 60 days to make sure they processed the IBR correctly, and that my payment was n't really due today, but since it was processing on autopay they could n't do anything about it. They should have suspended my payment for 60 days the first time so that this whole mess would not have happened!

Wells Fargo representatives told me that if I could bring the account current they could consider, but they did not feel it will work because I do not earn the income I need to make payments on the loans.

I only asked if they could temporarily for remaining term of the loan allow {$1000.00} payment and what ever balance was then due we will paid it off as a balloon payment.

703256,"This is in rebuttal to original dispute XXXX. 
To clarify - XXXX does not have the account. The account is with The Bureaus collection agency. 
I have disputed the issue with the reporting company but have not received a final response other than what shows on my credit tracking apps. 
I could argue that several of the reasoning options listed above would suffice as a grounds for complaint, ie., did not get proper help over the phone, problem with statement of dispute, investigation took too long, etc. ... .and, I could probably add a few more not listed. I am frustrated! 
My complaint is against Equifax for not addressing my dispute with original creditor ( collection agency ) with proper ethics and advocacy on my part. I have disputed this balance several times now with Equifax because the original creditor will not comply with requests for itemized and detailed invoices and line item charges which I have requested multiple times from collection agency who now has this account. My purpose in requesting these was to instigate an affidavit of unauthorized charges on this original account. I get nowhere with collection agency and in fact am told that they are only required to provide basic and satisfying information to validate the debt to the reporting credit bureau. I know it is my account, however, the question is accuracy of amount due because of these unauthorized charges. My complaint with original creditor is that these unauthorized charges are the result of retailer ( in this case XXXX ) not verifying my identity with proper ID at time of purchase therefore allowing unauthorized person ( XXXX ) to charge to my account. Twice, attempts were made with representative XXXX at collection agency ( The Bureaus ) but told each time that his agency does not get those documents from the original creditor and therefore can not and is not required to supply them to me or to the reporting credit bureaus. I had even sent, via mail, a request for documents and NOT EVEN a response back. 
At this time, this is neither here nor there now as I have moved past trying to get the collection agency to provide my requests and now see that my time is wasted dealing with the collection agency as I was getting nowhere. Therefore, I directed my complaint to Equifax in the hope that their investigation would prompt collection agency to provide accurate account information. 
Equifax has a responsibility in proper investigating and in reporting to me the timely status of the investigation instead of the dry and customary "" meets FCRA requirements ''. I have disputed this twice now ( three if you count the initial phone call dispute ) with Equifax and do n't even get the courtesy of a letter or email to notify me of status or findings. I am very frustrated and feel as though I have no rights in this matter and have gotten nowhere in following recommended protocol and steps for resolution. This has been an education for me and I have learned that the reporting bureaus do n't have to substantiate anything except known public record type of information to satisfy the proof of debt. The credit process has been made to be a black or white issue with reporting and follows a general set of guidelines and protocol therefore making it a laborious process to communicate situations and disputes that are not always black or white and do require more ethical investigation than just the standardized proof of debt validation. On top of this, it has easy to see the close relationship that the bureaus keep with the lenders and creditors that works against the borrower in many cases when a person such as myself has to fight for my right to obtain information and request dispute resolutions. 
For final disposition on this matter, I request that this be removed from my report with Equifax as I see no other viable or satisfying solution and have exhausted all resources.",Credit reporting
536503,"I was provided PMI cancellation documentation with my mortgage and on monthly statements, which Wells Fargo did not want to honor.

I called that day to find out what this was for since I checked the balance late Thursday night and it was positive. I also received a payroll deposit Friday morning. On the phone I spoke with someone who said that my available balance was negative at the time of  XXXX  transactions. This was NOT the case, since we had checked the balance on the mobile app before doing those transactions, and there were sufficient funds available. The representative on the phone was very rude and accusatory. I asked to speak to a manager and he said there was a long wait. I said I would wait, and he told me I could n't wait and that they will call me back. I never received a call back. I sent an email through the website and received a response that still did not clarify how this happened, just that no fees could be refunded because it was n't their fault.     After doing further research on my own, it looks like a transaction I made several days earlier at a gas station did not post until late Thursday, AFTER we had done all the other transactions. It seems to be a pretty deceptive practice to hold funds from a debit card transaction for several days without posting. Other bank accounts I have post these funds very quickly, even when the transaction is not PIN-based. I do n't like using my PIN at a gas station because we have been scammed by a skimming device before.     Regardless, the mobile app showed a sufficient available balance before doing each transaction. And while I understand it is my responsibility to keep track of a pending transaction, it does not seem reasonable that a bank would not post a transaction for several days, then all of the sudden decide to post it and charge  XXXX  overdraft fees. At the VERY least, if I was overdrawn because of the  XXXX  gas transaction, that should cause  XXXX  charge and not  XXXX . This looks like manipulation of the posting order to gouge customers with overdraft fees.

392458,"Since late 2016 Key Bank acquired First Niagara Bank. We have XXXX varied checking accounts and XXXX loans that were transitioned. We 've used Bill Pay systems for many years at First Niagara and other banks, including XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. By comparison, Key Bank 's Bill Pay System is antiquated, horrendous and corrupt. The system WILL NOT save preferences on from which account payees should be paid, and WILL NOT permit addition of a comment or memo with an electronic payment not issued as a paper check. The system WILL deduct the amount of a scheduled payment from your account IMMEDIATELY, even though a paper check is usually not delivered to the payee for about a week. Most banks deduct a payment from the available balance when a check clears, NOT when it is issued. But Key Bank takes money out of your account in the interim and you have NO access to the funds that are held by Key bank even though a check has not yet cleared. When a check is UN-DELIVERABLE due to quirky Bill Pay rules about no XXXX in an address field, you have NO WAY of knowing that your payment has been returned to the bank because your balance has been deducted for the amount of the check, but the payee has not received it. So late charges and fees from your payee could be applied. When you receive another bill and find out the payment was never received from Key, they put you on hold to research and inform you the check was returned to Key WEEKS AGO, but you have seen no credit for this returned check to your account balance. What happens if I did not call to ask about the payment? After 3 MONTHS, Key would return the money to my account!!! ( supposedly ) This sounds like Key is stealing consumers money! You need to RESEND a check to the payee after changing the address, and now your account is deducted TWICE for the SAME AMOUNT! Key states that they need to Stop Payment on the check Key has already received back! Should I have been appreciative that they waived stop payment fees? Maybe.. but just a little until a week later when the initial amount deducted from our balance for the undelivered, stopped payment check is STILL MISSING from the account. So a week after calling Key about the lost check we have paid this bill twice, the amount is DEDUCTED from our account balance 2 TIMES, and the payee has not even received a single check yet ... COUNT ON 2 WEEKS TO SEE A CREDIT!!! Because when you call their support team, another rep tells you what the first one did not, that the credit they applied of your own money ( that is still in Key Bank 's hands ) takes 7-10 business days to go back to your account! If they take payments out immediately, why can they not apply a Stop Payment immediately? Probably so they can charge fees unnecessarily if consumers ' balances get lower than some threshold or worse yet, get overdrawn. Deposits are handled horrendously as well. A CASH deposit is NOT credited to your account on the same day it is made - it is pending until one day later. And a check deposit of a large sum was held for 12 DAYS! This check cleared the payers ' bank after 4 days, and after calling to see why the full check deposit was not credited to our account, we were informed that our local Branch manager had put a hold on our deposit, and as he was on a three-week leave of absence, NO ONE ELSE AT KEY BANK could lift the hold on a deposited check until a week later as the check had been ordered to be held for 10 business days by the manager. Other banks in our experience have never handled deposits in such a manner.

I have been turned down several times for an FHA first time buyers home loan because of this. I bought a trailer from Vanderbilt on an installment contract. This was not a mortgage, it was an installment contract - no land was involved, nowhere on the contract does it say mortgage, I did n't sign a mortgage, there is no mortgage recorded in the public records and the trailer is on a rented lot in a trailer park with the wheels and axles still on it. I voluntarily surrendered the trailer in XX/XX/XXXX. Per my request, Vanderbilt sent me a Letter on dated XX/XX/XXXX stating this was not a mortgage foreclosure but it is still reporting on all 3 credit bureaus as a mortgage, preventing me from buying a house. I 'm not sure what to do. I have been paying for services from XXXX for about 6 months trying to get my credit score up and now it was all for nothing because I have been turned down by several lenders because of Vanderbilt and now those hard inquiries have dropped my score from a XXXX to a XXXX. Please let me know if you can get this account to report as an installment agreement instead of a mortgage.

After receiving the check the individual that the check was written out to was unsuccessful in cashing it and the check bounced, after which that individual acquired {$12.00} in fees. After it was brought to my attention, I was perplexed as to why the check would bounce, since I specifically inquired about my balance that same week while I was depositing my funds. After investigating the issue and spending a substantial amount of my time at the bank, I was informed that the reason why my check bounced was "" inconsistencies with my signature. '' Although, I appreciate the efforts of Wells Fargo to protect their clients from fraudulent activities, I am extremely upset that Wells Fargo would not make any attempts to contact me before canceling my OWN check and causing me so much stress and time on resolving this issue. I did not receive any notification or messages informing me of the issue and the check was simply canceled and I almost ended up losing extremely valuable transaction and prior deposits that were associated with that transaction! I was also informed that I may be charged additional fees ( {$35.00} XXXX in regards to this transaction. I am perplexed on how I ca n't assign my own funds and Wells Fargo can simply just cancel a transaction because "" it seemed like it was n't my signature '' and for Wells Fargo not make a reasonable attempt in contacting me. The account was opened 10 years ago and there might be minor changes in signatures for different reasons like older age. I 'm just wondering why Wells Fargo did n't bounce all of my other checks that were substantially smaller in their amount value, since I write out a lot of them every month. My signatures vary and are not identical every time. It seems that it only benefits Wells Fargo. I had to repay the {$12.00} to the individual for acquiring the fees, additionally had to pay {$10.00} for the cashiers check because I could n't use my OWN check. I do n't see the purpuse of having checks if i ca n't use them. Also, I was informed that for the issue to be resolved I had to write a letter explaining the situation, which I did. It was still not good enough and I was continuously transferred from one department to the next. Wells Fargo representative informed me that they would reimburse me, but they could n't since the receiving party was not a Wells Fargo customer. Does n't make sense to me! They are essentially admitting their fault but ca n't resolve the issue. Every time I will have to write a check for a large amount, I have to notify them?!? It is so frustrating to feel like you have done everything right on your part and you still ca n't get a resolution. 
I would like for the issue to be resolved and all of the fees associated with this transaction reimbursed or stopped, since I do n't feel that I should be held accountable for Wells Fargo 's inadequate assumptions about my own signature. Additionally this account is a joint account and both names on the account have the same initials, hence the confusion might of emerged from there.

I immediately filed a police report, contacted the FTC, OAG office, and the CRA 's to start the grueling process of returning my personal credit score to where it was before this debilitating act of fraud was committed against me. I can not get a mortgage loan, bank account, car lease, or any other forms of banking and or financial products and services now because of this company violating my rights under the Victims of Identity theft ACT, initiated by the federal government. I do not know what more I can do to get this company to respond to my repeated pleading of removing the fraudulent and inaccurate negative information to the credit reporting agencies. I am also at risk of potentially losing my job due to a new policy that is going to go in to affect with my company due to the poor credit score and history that I am being punished with for a crime someone else committed.

293966,"Hi, This account was settled between us and the landlord outside of court, and was never supposed to be entered into the court system at all. We went in front of a majestrate and came to a mutual agreement and settled. And since then had paid a long time ago. Its been a long time now, and I got a email saying that I have an update to my credit report and when I went in it said that I have a public record on my credit report. 
I wrote them a letter requesting that they send me some information back validating all this information and never received anything back. That was months ago. 
Also I 've called the court a few times, and they said that they do not know why it was ever entered into the system and they would fix it, and again that never happened. And now its appearing on my credit report. 
The court has said multiple times to us that there is no reason for it to have been entered and it must have been a mistake for some reason. But it makes no sense why out of the blue its being put on my credit report. 
I can not afford to have this on my credit report, I have been trying so hard to build up my credit for years now, just to have it knocked down by something that I am not even responsible for. 
Please can you help me? I do not know what else to do? 
I also tried to contact my prior landlord at least 10 times now, and nothing. No return call. 
Ive left messages at his business, and on his cell phone that I had the number from years back. I do not know if thats the same number, but at the business they said many times he would call back. And he never does. 
I can not wait any longer on this. This is not fair at all to me, I did everything that I needed to do to fix that and have no idea why this is happening. 
Please again I just beg that you will be able to assist me with this. This is the last place that I can turn to. No one else responds, or does what they state that they will do, and take this off of my credit report. 

Also it is only showing up on Transunion so far, but they always just come back with that it is my account and is valid. Anytime I have ever needed help for anything to do with my credit report Transunion is never helpful. Its like they do not even look into anything and just automatically say it belongs to me. So I know that it will go to them, but I ask that it can be overlooked by you guys since they really do not seem to do anything when I ask for any help with anything. Besides kind of blow me off.

My wife and I were divorced in XXXX. She was awarded the house and required to refinance both mortgages within 24 months. She never refinanced and ultimately fell behind on the payments. In XXXX, she abandoned the property and filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy. Since my name was still on the loan, I began proceedings with XXXX XXXX to attempt a short sale of the property, which would be beneficial to both them ( certainly more money than a foreclosure ) and myself. After considerable time working with XXXX XXXX just to get authorizations in place for them to talk to us and the our attorneys ( considering the bankruptcy ) we were finally able to provide XXXX XXXX with a listing agreement and an immediate offer in XXXX XXXX. Following this, my attorney and my realtor both stayed in constant communication with XXXX XXXX, sending, re-sending, re-sending again the same paperwork over and over. Then, in XXXX XXXX, we were advised that we were approved for a ... modification! We did not ask for a modification, nor did one make any sense. I 've lived in my new house since XXXX, and my ex-wife had abandoned the old old a year and half prior. Inexplicably, this un-requested event also required that we start completely over with the short sale process. Again, documents were sent and resent, discussions over the same points over and over again, and weekly calls were scheduled between my attorney and XXXX XXXX. Note that within this period ( XXXX XXXX ) an appraisal requested by XXXX XXXX also came back at {$80000.00}.

Unfortunately, immediately upon getting approval for the short sale, we get notice that XXXX XXXX is selling the first mortgage to Selene Financial!. Selene summarily rejects XXXX XXXX 's approval, makes us send in duplicate paperwork again, not even talking to my attorney or realtor until authorization forms are received, even though multiple copies of the forms have been sent in. Now, in XXXX XXXX, after receiving all documents requested from us, Selene informs us that they are rejecting the short sale request, as their own appraisal is $ XXXX. They refuse to provide documentation on their inexplicably high appraisal and are now requesting even more paperwork to even consider further negotiations. There is no possible way this property is worth $ XXXX in its current state. It has been abandoned for almost 2 years now, with XXXX maintenance, and losing value every day.

1005278,"I have been battling with XXXX and subsequently, Seterus ( whom they sold the mortgage to ) for several years. To be clear, I had both a first and second mortgage with XXXX which they then sold to the later company. I went through a horrible health stretch from the years XX/XX/XXXX til XX/XX/XXXX. I explained this to XXXX at least hundreds of times through letters, emails, and voluminous calls. At times they were sympathetic, at times threatening, but rarely helpful. I even, on several occasions, wrote to XXXX XXXX, the CEO of XXXX. My only goal was to refinance my mortgage so that my payments were more within my ability to pay during the trying times I experienced due to my health. I was stonewalled and given the ever bureaucratic run around. Finally, I was assigned to a woman in the mortgage department who dealt with such issues on a regular basis named XXXX. I am sorry I do not have her last name. But internal XXXX docs will be able to identify her. She counseled me SPECIFICALLY to stop making payments. She said that the best way to qualify for a refi was to demonstrate distress through NOT paying. I did as I was told, and within 9 months of taking her advice I was approved for a HAMP modification. I was told and sold that everything within this program was going to help. I ALWAYS pay my debts, and therefor bankruptcy was never an option for me. It is against my moral fabric. If I had done so when my health issues began I would already be out of the reporting woods, but I never considered that an option. I borrowed the money. I needed to pay it back! I received the loan docs and quickly signed them. My monthly payment dropped, and I was able to afford to stay in my home. Once again, this entire process was navigated by XXXX. I would never have come up with this solution on my own. I have paid dearly for this in two distinct ways. First, when I sold my home to relieve the financial pressure on me, there was a balloon payment that NEVER appeared on any of my mortgage statements. This didn't come to light until the final closing docs were generated. This payment was nearly 60k, which, in order to sell my home, necessitated with 2 days notice before closing, me stroking a check for XXXX instead of me pocketing XXXX. What a horrible eye opener. But XXXX and XXXX received EVERY dime I ever owed them, with a handsome profit to boot. So, that happened. Then I started to notice that my credit reports and scores were dinged nearly irreparably as a result of me following XXXX counsel. So not only did I make good on every penny I owed them, they penalized me without notification because I merely did as they told me to do! These unfair practices are beyond reprehensible. They negotiated with a man who was on deaths door in bad faith. They took advantage of someone they knew was in a desperate situation. They are predators, plain and simple. They benefitted by knowing my commitment to repay all of my debts. The preyed upon the weak. I am no longer week. I run a XXXX XXXX XXXX and my income, and health, are now better than ever.

If you require any email correspondence proving any of our claims, we are happy to provide them. 


Hello, My wife and I reached out to Stonegate about refinancing our loan around mid XXXX ( the first email we have is from XXXX/XXXX/15 ). We agreed to terms and were told on or before XXXX/XXXX/15 that we would be closing mid XXXX. To be more specific, we were told XXXX/XXXX/15 that "" Your appraisal just came in and your file has been forwarded to underwriting. '' Each and every time anything was requested of us, we responded with what was required immediately. After following up a number of times, being shifted around to different representatives, having additional documents requested of us, etc, we were told XXXX/XXXX/15 that "" We got extremely busy over the last 5 months which has caused tremendous delays. '' Following that, we had to get another appraisal since it had been so long, send in additional documents, and we finally closed XXXX/XXXX/15. Nearly five months after we were told it would take place. 

During that time, we paid PMI on a loan that we would n't have if it had closed when we were told it would and also paid interest at a rate XXXX of a point higher than we should have been. 

After repeated attempts by Stonegate to renege on the terms we agreed to because it took them so long that the "" market had moved '', we did, in fact, receive the loan at those terms. In addition, we were refunded the amount we paid for PMI as a result of Stonegate 's delays. However, we also need to be refunded for the additional interest that we should not have paid during that time period, as the delays were admittedly Stonegate 's fault. 

We will be awaiting your response.

I then withdrew {$1000.00} and paid the Auto loan twice. One {$500.00} payment for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and the second {$500.00} payment for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Although the bank personnel apologized for the oversight, the bank still damaged my credit rating by placing a 30 day late payment on my XXXX and Equifax credit reports. I request immediate assistance at reversing the banks unjust intentional negligence and a immediate restoration of my good payment record on my auto loan.

432871,"Back in XXXX I communicated with a collection agency named Continental Central Credit. I spoke to them because they had a collection account in their office which they were reporting on my credit report. When I spoke with this collection agency, I spoke with an individual by the name of XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX was the collector who was in charge of this particular account. When I spoke with him, I explained my situation to him and we had agreed upon me paying an amount of {$700.00} as well as having the account removed from my credit report due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the nature of the debt. We agreed that I would post date a payment on the XXXX of XXXX because that is when I got paid for the month. I only get paid once a month. 

I thought the situation was taken care of until I received another notice saying that they will sue me if I do n't pay the amount of the post dated payment as well as a {$25.00} Non sufficient fund fee. At this point I had my representative step in and try to figure out what was going on because I know I had funds in my bank account. In fact, because of this entire ordeal, I was forced to go to my bank and provide them documentation about the non sufficient funds to figure out what was happening and I also printed out a statement which shows I had money in the bank at that time. 

After further review, my representative then noticed that the date the collection agency attempted to withdraw funds was listed the XXXX of XXXX and not the XXXX of XXXX as XXXX XXXX XXXX and I had agreed upon. My representative then spoke to the collection agency to ask why they were attempting to charge me non sufficient fund fees as well as threaten to sue me if they had attempted to withdraw funds on a date that was not agreed upon. The response that he received was truly exasperating. 

The collector XXXX stated that we had n't agreed upon the XXXX but the XXXX. He claimed that to have it in by the XXXX it had to be withdrawn then. That statement was a complete falsehood. Besides the obvious fact that the XXXX was days after XXXX therefore chances are I did n't have money to spend, but it 's also days before I get paid and therefore I would never agree to such a deal. Furthermore, when my representative attempted to play nice and chalk it up to a whole misunderstanding and to offer them the same amount as before which was the {$700.00}, the collector said he could n't do it because the funds had to be withdrawn before the XXXX of XXXX. He also made a statement that the settlement offer was no longer valid. At this point my representative asked for the Supervisor. 

The supervisor was named XXXX XXXX. he tried to explain to her the entire situation. He informed her that the funds withdrawal was according to their own documentation attempted on the wrong dates. He also informed her that I was willing to still pay the agreed upon amount. She would n't hear any of it. Although her tone was very cordial, she simply reiterated what the collector tried to tell me and instead of noticing that they had wronged me and were attempting to wrong me more, she tried to focus on why I was able to afford the full amount and therefore did not require a settlement. At this point they are being malicious and they have broken the law. 

They essentially pulled a bait and switch on me. They lied to me in order to collect more money than agreed upon, attempted to withdraw money when they were n't supposed to, and now they are attempting to extort illegal non sufficient fees and treble damages. 

At this point I am very upset and if they attempt to sue me for these ridiculous charges, I will counter sue. I ca n't believe a collection agency is allowed to operate like this.

585183,"Dear Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, I am writing to you because the Office of the Attorney General recommended your assistance to my case. 

My name is XXXX and I am seeking legal advice. I was recently scammed by an employer online through XXXX who exploited me using fake cashier 's checks. He asked me to deposit the cashier 's checks and then wait until the funds became available. The funds became available the following day. He asked me to take the funds out of my account and deposit them into another account as a task under his employment. The tasks were to send money to an employee at a foster care home so that the employee could buy toys for the foster children. 

A few days later, I noticed that my bank account was at a negative balance. I went to my bank, Wells Fargo, to figure out what was happening with my account. The employees at Wells Fargo told me that the cashier 's check had been put on hold and eventually returned as a stop payment. This was the point in which I had realized that I had been scammed. I had no idea that the banks could authorize a cashier 's check and then have it be returned. Since the money from the cashier 's check had already been taken out, Wells Fargo proceeded to take the money that was returned from the check out of my account, leaving my account at a negative balance. 

I have already filed an ICC report through the FBI, but I have not heard from them since I filed the complaint on XXXX, 2017. I have insufficient information on the employer that scammed me, but I did give the FBI information on the name, account number and routing number of the person 's Wells Fargo account that I had deposited the cash into. I believe I have given the FBI enough information to at least track down an accomplice to the scammer. 

I am currently waiting for a response from the FBI because I do not believe I should be held responsible for the fake cashier 's checks. Wells Fargo never once told me that the checks were fake. They simply told me that the cashier 's check was returned by the maker. I do not understand how the bank can allow fake cashier 's checks through their system. I went to the police before I filed the ICC report and the police told me to not pay the banks back. 

I am seeking legal advice because I am not sure if I have a case here. Wells Fargo were the ones that authorized the check. I had no idea at the time that the check was fake. I am confused as to how Wells Fargo let fake cashier 's checks through their system. I am unwilling to pay Wells Fargo back since they authorized the checks and made the funds available to me.

731198,"I originated a 20yr fixed mortgage on XXXX with XXXX Bank and at closing, I received a Federal Private Mortgage Disclosure for Residential Loans. XXXX See Attached XXXX This showed that the "" Original Value '' of the property was $ XXXX at that time. The document also shows that paying PMI was supposed to be "" Automatically Terminated '' on XXXX. At this point, the principle reached 78 % of the "" Original Value '' of the property. The payments were $ XXXX/month. I confirmed that the loan is a XXXX backed loan. 




XX/XX/XXXX I obtained a loan modification with XXXX XXXX XXXX, the new servicer of the loan, through the Home Affordable Modification Program, HAMP. ( Also see attached ) The principle balance, interest rates, and the maturity date changed by the agreement. This would of course change an amortization schedule, I realize that. During the modification process, there was no appraisal done on the home nor was I ever notified that the "" Original Value '' of the home was to change from the original loan conditions. I received no disclosures of any kind nor was I notified of a new PMI "" Automatic Termination '' date. The servicing of the loan had been taken over by Seterus XXXX Inc. shortly after the modification. I noted that interestingly, the $ XXXX/month payment stayed the same and noted that the modification was never recorded into XXXX XXXX records. If my PMI was adjusted to reflect the new loan conditions, why would the payment still be identical? 




Recently, I have been attempting to refinance my mortgage with XXXX XXXX as I qualify for the HARP Program. They tell me that since I am currently paying PMI, it would be a requirement of the new loan but based off of the rent market conditions. Essentially, I would have to again pay PMI for the next who-knows-when. This has caused me to contact Seterus and inquire about my PMI and find a of my paperwork. This is when I discovered a potential problem in what I was told vs. given in writing. When I have not been getting hung up on, Seterus has been interesting to work with to say the least. I keep getting different answers from everyone I speak with and the last was a supervisor. He told me that the only way for me to drop PMI was to send in a request and {$350.00} for an appraisal. I know my loan is currently nowhere near 80 % LTV under current market conditions but it is well under that based off of the last appraised "" Original Value. '' I asked for him to provide me with an actual date for "" Automatic Termination '' and he told me that there is not one. The only way to drop it is by me initiating a "" Cancellation. "" It is interesting to note that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a bulletin dated just earlier this month warning loan servicers of violations of the Homeowner Protection Act. ( Attached ) When I called them and explained my issue, they told me to definitely file a complaint. 




My contentions are this : A ) I was never notified of any change of conditions of my PMI and as a matter of fact, the payments actually stayed the same even though the loan amounts and terms changed. 




B XXXX The Modification Agreement specifically states on page XXXX ( F ) that unless the terms are "" Expressly modified by this agreement ), the initial load documents remain in effect. 




C XXXX The reply to my inquires to Seterus appear to be in violation of the Homeowners Protection Act by not only not disclosing PMI terms, but also appears that the PMI terms were never re-calculated to reflect the modification. XXXX See attached document HPA.pdf page XXXX ( D ) )",Mortgage

We called first thing in the morning and spoke to a rep about the hold. They advised the hold was placed due to our account history and the size of the check. We asked if there was a way to verify the amount was good with the other bank to remove the hold faster as it is essential more of the money be released, but the rep advised the hold would remain until XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX for the amounts no matter what. We requested to speak with a supervisor but were advised one was n't available and would call us within 24hrs. We called back again that morning due to the urgency of the matter and spoke to another rep that stated there was no one who could remove the hold and we were basically wasting our time.

We again requested to speak with a manager and were told one would call back within 24hrs. We advised we could n't wait that long as this was an emergency for us and indicated we could wait until a manager became available. The rep placed us on hold but when they returned they again stated no manager was available but they would try to have one call back as quickly as possible.

I called again as we had n't heard from a manager yet but the call with the first rep I spoke with disconnected from their end after a hold. When I called back I advised that I felt the amount being held was in violation of fed reserve guidelines and I wanted to give them a chance to resolve the issue prior to making a complaint but was told there was no one who could alter the hold. This time they stated that the way the money was deposited ( it was deposited as instructed by a usaa rep ) was what resulted in a hold that no one could remove. We believe USAA placed more of our funds on hold than they should have and failed to adequately address our concerns.

105934,"Dear CFPB : This was prepared as my Dispute of XXXX Bank 's Response in Case Number XXXX. The CFPB website, due to a technical glitch, will not permit the Dispute to be submitted. Consequently, I am filing a new Complaint. However, this should be consolidated with the aforementioned Case. 
This case pertains to the refund of tax overpayments by banks to their home mortgage customers. It is a standard practice for a homeowner with a mortgage that escrows taxes to pay real property taxes TWICE when a home is sold near the beginning of a tax year. When this happens, the taxing authority ( in my case, XXXX County, Maryland ) refunds the surplus tax payment to the homeowner. The procedure it follows for making this refund is as follows : half of the amount due is sent directly to the homeowner ; the other half is sent to the pertinent mortgage bank for repayment to its home mortgage customer. Accordingly, XXXX County made the direct payment of half the tax refund due ( {$10000.00} XXXX. It sent the other half to US Bank 's agent for tax payments and refunds, a company called XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, has advised, in writing, that the latter payment cleared XXXX XXXX, 2016. Nevertheless, after the passage of four months, the tax refund of {$10000.00} is still in US Bank 's hands. 
So how did US Bank respond to these allegations when made in Case number XXXX? It pointed to the payment of {$10000.00} and implied that was everything to which I was entitled. The Bank ignored the payment by XXXX County of the second half of the tax refund to its collection agent, XXXX, for repayment to me. 
I have furnished US Bank with written documentation from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that it directly paid me a tax refund of {$10000.00}, representing half the sum due, and that it it paid the Bank 's agent, XXXX, the remaining tax refund of {$10000.00} earmarked for me. The written documentation confirms that saif payment to US Bank 's agent cleared XXXX, XXXX, 2016. 
Given these representations, is n't it clear that US Bank is either engaged in intentional obfuscation with the intent to defraud, or that its banking practices are sloppy and lack adequate controls. Either way, it is not reasonable to assume that the Bank 's mishandling of the tax refund is limited to my ordeal. The stronger assumption is that US Bank 's mishandling of tax refunds, whether due to intentional conversion or inadequate internal controls, is injuring a broad swathe of its home mortgage customers. 
For the forgoing reasons, I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate : 1 ) US Bank 's refusal to pay the {$10000.00} tax refund sent to it by XXXX County on my behalf ; and 2 ) US Bank 's tax refund practices and procedures across the base of its home mortgage customers.

971077,"Navient Account # XXXX Starting in XX/XX/XXXX, I had set up an interest only payment plan for 6 months with Navient. Their program allows you to switch from full payment, to interest only payments for up to 6 months. 

I have always paid my Navient loans on time, and have never missed a payment. 

Since switching to the interest only payments, Navient has consistently messed up on the allocation of funds. Even though they are the ones that established the monthly amount of {$570.00}, every month once payment is applied they tell me I underpaid. 

That means that every month I 've been on this program, I 've had to call in after payment was made, and have them put me on hold for 30 minutes just so they can fix the account. Each time they tell me that the problem has been resolved and it wo n't happen again, but it does. 

Now they are sending me e-mails and letters saying that I 'm past due again ( for XX/XX/XXXX ). 

They also changed the amount I needed to pay during the interest only period due to their calculation error.

I was making {$580.00} payments XXXX every month from my checking account, I have the statements to prove this. Despite this, every month I would get harassed by XXXX debt collectors telling me I was delinquent. When I provided documentation, they would always agree I was making payments, and then would assure me with 100 % certainty I am fine. They said the only reason they were harassing me is because they need to see ( 6 ) months of payment. Until then, they said, the account would remain delinquent. I, like a fool, believed this ( so did my co-signer Aunt, an XXXX executive, we were assured constantly ). 

Come XXXX, I got a threatening phone call from an "" upper level collections agent '' XXXX telling me my account was some 200 days past due, and that everything had been reported to a credit bureau, and that I needed to pay up immediately the thousands I owed. When I once again proved my account was being paid every single month, she concluded I must have accidentally been removed from the program XX/XX/XXXX due to a processing error, never informed, and that none of my payments have counted for anything. 

After several phone calls with upper level management, I proved my case was correct. It was no small task, because at every level they accuse you of being a liar. The eventually brought my account current and reduced my payments to $ XXXX/mo. However, when I inquired about the restoration of my credit, they said they were powerless. I would have to send my information to their "" credit bureau '' ( literally another department XXXX ) to be confirmed.

Unfortunately, this poor credit has now affected my housing. I do not qualify to live in the cheapest apartment I can find. They have tarnished my reputation, and it 's bleeding into every other aspect of my life. I can not afford for their "" independent investigation '' to not tell the truth. In my recent attempts to collect a simple letter from them, proving my innocence to my potential landlord, they refused. XXXX XXXX was the chief perpetrator of this, and now it 's Navient. 

Navient 's records supposedly show that I was simply a delinquent payer from XXXX 2014 - XXXX 2014. When I explained to them I have already been apologized to for this entire incident, and that he needs to check his notes, he simply said I was not telling the truth. His words were "" we 'll have to agree to disagree on whether or not you actually made any payments ''. This was the Supervisor, XXXX XXXX, of the Rate Reduction Department. 

At a deeper level, I ca n't continued to be treated like some free-loading criminal, ignorant of finance, blind to obligation, and devoid of responsibility.

I was told the wires would cost {$35.00} each. No other fees would be required as I was told there was a current promotion for new accounts where monthly fees were waived for the first year. I thought that's great! So I was initially happy and satisfied with the new account and service. Now fast forward one month and I get a overdraft notice from my bank. I am overdrawn by {$160.00}. I logged into my account to see that I was charged an account Analysis fee of {$180.00}. I immediately called the bank rep who opened my account and could not initially get in touch with her.

I got a call a few days later from the branch manager who made an appointment for me to come in and talk in a couple of days.

She advised me that I was signed up for a service that requires higher fees. I explained to her that I did not need any service and that I only signed up for a simple checking account.

891663,"Equifax, one of the three major consumer credit reporting agencies, said on Thursday that hackers had gained access to company data that potentially compromised sensitive information for 143 million American consumers, including Social Security numbers and drivers license numbers.
Last year, identity thieves successfully made off with critical W-2 tax and salary data from an Equifax website. And earlier this year, thieves again stole W-2 tax data from an Equifax subsidiary, TALX, which provides online payroll, tax and human resources services to some of the nations largest corporations.
My complaint is after being hacked twice Equifax on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX did not improve its security practices after those previous thefts, and they noted that thieves were able to get the companys crown jewels through a simple website vulnerability.
Criminals gained access to certain files in the companys system from mid-XX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/XXXX by exploiting a weak point in website software, according to an investigation by Equifax and security consultants. The company said that it discovered the intrusion onXX/XX/XXXXbut failed to notify me via email, phone call or an alert from Equifax themselves since I am a member In addition to the other material, hackers were also able to retrieve names, birth dates and addresses. Credit card numbers for 209,000 consumers were stolen, while documents with personal information used in disputes for 182,000 people were also taken.
After the cyber attack, three senior executives, including the companys chief financial officer, XXXX XXXX sold shares worth almost {$1.00} million in the days after the breach was discovered. This sounds very fishy to me.
Using the data stolen from Equifax, identity thieves can impersonate me with lenders, creditors and service providers, who rely on personal identity information from Equifax to make financial decisions regarding potential customers.
So far, I checked if I was affected using Equifax 's website here : https : //www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/potential-impact/ And it said that I maybe one of the millions impacted by this cyber security breach. I feel very let down and very vulnerable after hearing this news, especially when it involves my privacy and personal information which can lead to identity theft or worse.

I received notice that the loan had been sold to Nationstar Mortgage Company, with the first payment to them being due XX/XX/XXXX. Nationstar 's notice also advised that any "" Optional Payments '' on the account may be cancelled. I called the company immediately upon receiving the letter and asked if the PMI was to be cancelled. Nationstar 's representative told me the loan did not include PMI. I argued with the representative, but to no avail. Over the years, I have contacted Nationstar numerous times about the PMI and they have consistently denied that I am being charged the PMI. The attached mortgage and first payment documents clearly state that PMI is included in the loan. When calling Nationstar after XXXX XXXX Central Time, you are directed to overseas representatives that are extremely hard to communicate with. Several times I 've simply had to hang up because I was unable to understand what the representative was saying. I have called during regular business hours and been told there is no PMI on the loan. I have also used Nationstar 's online application to submit questions about the PMI and have never received a response. Their online application only recently started documenting submitted questions and responses. Since buying the house in XX/XX/XXXX, my monthly mortgage payment has varied several times, due to changes in property taxes and homeowners insurance rates. I have attached all relevant documents, along with all Mortgage Interest Statements ( IRS Form XXXX ) from Nationstar that show no payments for Optional Insurance. 

The above information was submitted as claims to the Texas Dept of Insurance ( TDI ), then to the Texas Dept of Savings and Mortgage Lending ( DSML ). TDI replied that they do not service PMI. Following is a copy of the email I received from DSML 's XXXX XXXX concerning my claim ( note that XXXX XXXX refers to Nationstar by their new name, Mr. Cooper ) : Good afternoon, Thank you for returning my telephone call today. Per our telephone conversation, Mr. Coopers representative confirmed today that the {$44.00} PMI per month charge that has not been charged to your account up till XX/XX/XXXX when they corrected their records. The PMI over the last few years totals about {$1800.00} that is not being charged to your account nor it will be charged to your account, per the email of XX/XX/XXXX, below. 

XXXX XXXX representative response to the DSML reiterates that moving forward, they have corrected their records to reflect the {$44.00} PMI charge to your loan escrow account. Mr. Cooper has since this investigation began completed an out of cycle escrow analysis on XX/XX/XXXX. The new escrow analysis reflect a new payment of {$550.00}, effective with the XX/XX/XXXX installment. 

Once the full file has been reviewed you may be contacted with questions we may have and/or once a determination has been made. 

Note that Nationstar 's response to the claim was that the PMI had been cancelled due to non-payment of the policy, and I was never charged for PMI. 
After receiving this news, I contacted Nationstar on XX/XX/XXXX for a refinance quote. The Nationstar agent documented my house 's market value at {$77000.00}, and left that amount, even after I told him my XX/XX/XXXX County Tax Appraisal was only {$69000.00}. The refinance quote charges XXXX points for a 180 month conventional refi at 3.875 % interest.

The short sale and mortgage depts refused to communicate. Even though I had a short sale contract they still pursued foreclosure. So, I remodified the loan to buy some time while we found another buyer. Now we are on buyer number three. My realtor submitted to equator a week ago the short sale and BOA still has not initiated it. I have tried multiple phone numbers to contact them. I have tried the number which they have instructed me to use : XXXX. I enter my loan number and follow the prompts and then get a recording for a voice mail box.I left two messages last week. I have been calling for a week now and still get the same message. Every number I call for BOA I still get that voicemail recording. I even went on the website and tried to chat. It said nobody was available. I called the mortgage and home equity line just trying to get a live person and each time i end up at the voice recording. This has never happened in the past 1.5 years I have been dealing with them. So now, we have another buyer and another contract and BOA is impossible to reach.

That took six month for me to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to admit and issue me the opportunity to go through a XXXX modification. Only one month through the process they sold off the loan servicing to Seterus.

972318,"On XX/XX/XXXX I made application for a {$300000.00} HELOC at a BB & T branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX. XXXX XXXX, Assistant Vice President ( XXXX ) is the person that assisted me through this process. 

I have a current interest only HELOC in the amount of {$290000.00} with another bank which moved to a 4.50 % interest rate in XX/XX/XXXX. BB & T was/is offering an interest only rate at 2.99 % which will save me several hundred dollars per month for the 12 month promotional period. 

As a part of my application, I provided my complete XX/XX/XXXX tax return, a copy of my spouse 's Social Security benefit amount for calendar year XX/XX/XXXX ( Form XXXX ), a copy of my Social Security Administration Retirement Notice of Award which stated the date that my Social Security Benefit would begin along with the amount ( XX/XX/XXXX ), a hard copy verification of my spouse 's Pension Benefit from the XXXX Retirement System of Georgia, a copy of my current 401 ( K ) balance ( ~ {$510000.00} ) and a copy of my  current IRA balance ( ~ {$150000.00} ). I also advised that I retired from a 35 year career in XXXX XXXX  effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

My debts are a second home that carries a mortgage payment of $ XXXX/month, a charge card with a balance of ~ {$20000.00} and the {$290000.00} HELOC. Between my spouse and I, we have a charge card credit limit of ~ {$90000.00}. My spouse has a credit score of XXXX, I am at XXXX. 

It is my intent to sell our primary residence in 2-3 years therefore, I have gone the HELOC route, rather than a mortgage, as a way to finance the debt on the home. I have done this the past 3 years and have encountered no problems, up until now, in the application/acceptance process. 

However, this attempt has been denied as BB & T has indicated that my Debt-To-Income ratio ( DTI ) is too high. What has changed from my previous application periods is the fact that I am now retired. However, I spent my 32 year career saving enough to where I felt that, along with two Social Security incomes and a XXXX 's pension, our family could draw more than enough from our 401 ( k ) and IRA funds to meet whatever monthly obligations we incurred. BB & T indicates that the 401 ( k ) and IRA accounts can not be used in determining income. 

I am filing a complaint against this decision as I believe that the eRegulations, specifically Regulation Z, Appendix Q, Parts 10-26, address that 401 ( k ) and IRA balances are allowed to be considered as income if there has been a demonstrated history of consistent withdrawals from those accounts. My XX/XX/XXXX Federal Tax return showed ~ {$77000.00} in distributions from these retirement accounts. Although I had my XX/XX/XXXX Federal Tax Return with me at the meeting, it was deemed not necessary at the time of application. However, it also shows retirement distributions at a similar amount. I will not be filing my XX/XX/XXXX tax returns until XX/XX/XXXX so I do not have that document to provide as evidence for calendar year XX/XX/XXXX. But I do have statements from my IRA  showing withdrawals for that year. It is not clear to me in the regulations exactly how long this "" history of withdrawals '' must be but other web-searched articles range from as little as two months to as much as two years. My record is now 3 years. 

If you consider my XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX retirement plan withdrawals as a demonstrated source of income, then my DTI is well under what is being required. I have had multiple discussions with XXXX XXXX regarding my position. Although he is in support of my belief, he has not been able to obtain an answer from his underwriting team regarding my appeal of their decision. Because I feel that the Dodd/Frank regulations support my assertion as to my credit worthiness, I am filing this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the hope that a resolution may be obtained.

To	XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX:

The division is in receipt of your complaint regarding your credit report and the ""double"" reporting of the accounts being collected by Bonded Collections of Rice Lake, Inc. While this office does not regulate credit reporting activities, we can tell you how this ""double reporting"" occurs.  However, we cannot assist you in getting the double reporting removed.

The collection agency has an account or multiple accounts for a debtor and reports those accounts according to their agreement with the original creditor.  If the account is not paid, the collection agency may recommend to the client that they secure a judgment on the accounts.  A judgment is awarded by the courts and the judgment becomes a public record.

The credit bureaus search the public records and retrieve the information on any new judgments filed to include that information in their credit reports, thus, ""double reporting"" of the same accounts.  The reporting of the judgments is not done by the collection agencies.

Neither of these activities are illegal, yet the result would appear to violate the FCRA.

We will be making contact the Federal Trade Commission to see if I can get a response to what they think about such a situation.  If we receive a response, I will certainly provide you with that information.

While we are unable to assist you with your immediate complaint, I will forward your complaint to Bonded Collections of Rice Lake Inc so that they can provide their response.

We will contact you again once we have received that response.

If you have any questions, please contact me directly.

Thank you for the response I do understand that the ""double reporting"" is not a violation - My concern is Only that the reporting is doing ""double Damage"" to my credit score per single account- The reporting is no longer in dispute only that the damage is being done more than once per account-  I know this is not the crime of the century but like i said I believe Bonded to be most likely doing this to every person they have a default judgment against and are unfairly lowering the credit score of many people- 

Thank you for your time-

In XXXX it was to send all receipts for repairs to the home which I did. Because I wanted to mitigate my damages, I had paid for repairs to my home from my savings. In XX/XX/XXXX I was told I had to get carpeting estimates. I asked who was going to pay for it and was told if I wanted my money, I would have to submit the estimate. I paid for the estimate. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Fay Servicing again, and was told that I should basically pay for the carpeting I explained that one does not have insurance just to be reimbursed and that carpeting is not like other contractor expenses that you hire someone to install carpeting and they wait to be paid. I stated I needed the proceeds to continue and that I had already put more money into my home than I was receiving from the insurance company. In XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that Fay Servicing would have to send an inspector out for the damage. So in order for this to be done, I took the day off of work. Inspector agreed that all repairs to the home were completed except for new carpeting. Once again Fay Servicing held on to proceeds. In XX/XX/XXXX I notified Fay Servicing that I was putting my money into escrow. Informed Fay Servicing of the savings account number and what branch of my bank it was held.

After going through the loan process, I was denied at the appraisal stage due to the leaking roof and ceiling damage. It was stated that I do n't have sufficient collateral. The house is FULLY paid off and appraised at $ XXXX after repairs which were estimated at $ XXXX by the appraiser, yet Wells Fargo will not give me any type of loan. That is plenty of collateral. On my appraisal report, the appraiser mentioned that there is a possible foundation problem and a foundation inspection is recommended. They also told me this in person during the inspection. I had a certified contractor inspect the damage and he gave a preliminary report that no foundation damage was found. I submitted his report to my mortgage banker, and was then told that the report did n't matter because I was being denied solely on having a leaking roof and holes in my ceiling. After questioning why I was denied for that reason ( because they knew initially about the damage ), I was given the run around. I was passed around to different departments and given different reasons as to why I was denied in the end. After speaking with a manager, she informed me that a new department was just newly opened that would suit my needs perfectly ; A Home Renovation Mortgage. She said that all of my information would be forwarded to a loan consultant in that department, and I would still be able to keep my same interest rate that I was pre-approved for. After the renovation mortgage consultant looked over all of my files, he called and informed me that I was denied due to my credit score. He stated what the minimum credit score must be to obtain a renovation loan. I quoted him my credit score and told him it was higher than the minimum he just quoted me. He said he would need to talk to his manager and call me back. When he called me back, he said he was mistaken at the minimum required credit score was actually higher than what he had quoted me less than an hour prior. I then asked him about adding a co-signer on the loan application. He told me that I still would n't get approved. When I asked him why not, he could n't give me an answer. He just said it was n't possible with my current credit score. He had no idea what my co-signer 's credit score would be, nor their collateral. I then reached out to the manager once again. She stated that they planned on selling the loan to XXXX, and my home was ineligible due to the damage. She stated that in her 25 years experience, XXXX would never buy this loan due to the holes in my ceiling. However, my home was appraised at the XXXX level which XXXX does indeed buy loans for. I also did other research and found homes in which XXXX purchased the loans and they had the same type of damage that I currently have. I feel that I am being treated unfairly due to the location of my home which is in a predominately XXXX community. Everything was going well until they sent out an appraiser and saw the location of my home. I would like for you to look into the possibility of this being a discrimination issue because everything that 's been told to me from the bankers to the managers have been either contradictory, or just does n't make any logical sense.",Mortgage

895300,On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$100.00} on the fedloan website. I mistakenly put in the incorrect bank account number. The number I put in was to an old savings account that is still open. Days later I went in to schedule a payment of {$150.00} to be debited from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. At this time I still have no idea that my payment was declined or that I put in the wrong information. By or around XX/XX/XXXX I was notified by my bank that the XX/XX/XXXX charge was declined and with some research of my own I realized I entered the incorrect banking information. So that very day XX/XX/XXXX I went onto the fedloan website and entered in the correct banking information. I also then called fedloan to verify that the changes went through and to see if there was anything else I needed to do to ensure the bill would be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed by a representative named XXXX employee number XXXX that my bank account information was updated and I asked him if there was anything I needed to do. He informed me that by me changing the bank account information that will take effect immediately and that I did not have to make any changes to the payment that was pending for XX/XX/XXXX. Well XX/XX/XXXX came and the money was not taken from my account. I then logged online to fedloan again to ensure they had entered the correct information and it in fact was correct. So I thought that like most other institutions it would take 7-10 business days for both my bank account and the companies website to update and reflect the payment I gave it sometime. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from my bank that the payment was declined. So I noticed again that they were trying to debit my old savings account and not the checking account that I have on their site. So in fear I check my credit report and fedloan reported me to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. So since I received incorrect information from one of their representatives my credit has decreased by 75 points. Had the representative given me the correct information I would have made changes to the payment I had scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. I completely understand that I messed up on XX/XX/XXXX but I made every attempt to fix the issue and even called Fed Loan to ensure that a declined payment would not happen again. I have copies of my bank account showing I had the money and I have screenshots of the fedloan website showing that I changed the banking information to the correct information.It is sad that as a consumer I have zero choice in having to deal with this loan servicer when it is well known and by experience of my own that they are completely incompetent. In doing some research on this company many consumers have been given wrong information by Fed Loan representatives. For something this important I would think that all the employees would be properly trained to answer all questions and if they can not try to figure it out but do not give information that they are not certain about because it could effect more than just the account you have with them it can essentially effect someones entire life as it has for me. So now since I was given the wrong information I have figure out how to get this corrected and removed from my credit.,Student loan

I passed a Citizens Bank check book with the cash into the drive up window box with verbal instructions to deposit {$700.00} dollars into that check books account ( citizens went paperless and no longer has deposit slips so I gave the teller the check book temporally so she could have the correct account number ) and return to me {$600.00} in large {$100.00} dollar bills. 

I was was distracted because I got a cell phone call during the transaction and was also running a little late for appointment at my home. 

When the draw opened I reached in and retrieved the check book but in my haste forgot to check to see if the cash was inside the book. 

When I got home I realized the {$600.00} cash and the deposit slip was missing. I called the bank but it was too late they had just closed. I went on line banking ( thinking mayby the teller deposited the whole B {$1300.00} but only the {$700.00} deposit showed up. 

I went to the bank first thing Saturday morning only to be told the teller "" XXXX XXXX '' was not on duty today and I would have to come back Monday. On Monday I came in but the told me that I could not view the video of the transactor with out a police report. I filled out a police report at XXXX XXXX Police Station with Officer XXXX XXXX ( Incident Report # XXXX ) The teller stated to the police that she put the {$600.00} in a Citizens Bank Envelope and put it in the draw with the check book to return to me. 

Keep in mind the type of envelope she showed us that she used is larger that the check book register and cover, so even if the envelope was put inside the check book register when it was returned it would be hanging out the sides of the check book register ( see attached example photo ) and would be visible in the video tape of the transaction. 

Citizens Bank have let the police officer view the video but refuse to give permission to allow the video to be viewed by me, they claim it will allow me to see the angles the video camera records at and compromises their security. This is all a bunch of XXXX as the large camera that recorded the transaction is fully visible and directly over the tellers head and it is obvious which angle the camera is recording. 

Officer XXXX told me that the video clearly shows the green cash going into the bank draw for deposit but the return section of the video is jumpy and unclear and that it only shows me reaching in and retrieving something ( the check book, I know that because that was the only Item I had when I got home ). Officer XXXX when on to tll me that the video does not show any envelope being returned ( it was to unclear and jumpy ). 

I definitely and without a doubt did not get the {$600.00} cash or the deposit slip returned to me. 

This is not a mom and pop convenience store video and it would be expected that a clear video should be available as a record of this cash transaction. 

The Teller acknowledged to the police and I that she received {$1300.00} cash from me and only {$700.00} has been deposited into my account, so if they can not give proof that they returned the {$600.00} cash to me they should refund this money forthwith.

We are currently in court resolving this issue. See documents attached. This company has called me NUMEROUS times and i advised them of my situation. As they seem to be understanding however no one has took action nor updated the systems any time i called or a rep called. Then i called again today and told them i will not pay them anything until they take my name off the credit report and they told me they would sue me. I find that really funny because that is against the law not only that only i am able to sue you guys for the many phone calls i received and the lies and miscommunication. i have my notes of every single phone call and rep i spoke with and will show all this in court. I will be reporting them to every single media outlet i know. It is n't right.

935318,"This is regarding a collection account with the collector XXXX XXXX. The original creditor was XXXX XXXX XXXX They have sent me a letter through Fenton Law Firm from XXXX XXXX. 

I received a civil summons from Fenton Law Firm on behalf of XXXX XXXX months ago. There were no instructions on how to respond to it or who I could respond to. I sent an email to the law firms email address that was listed on the paperwork. They did not respond to me after many attempts to email them and follow up over a period of weeks and weeks. I then received a notice that a civil judgment had been filed against me with my local court. I had no idea how I was supposed to prevent this from happening and the law firm did not respond to my requests for assistance in settling this "" debt ''. 

The debt they are collecting is not fair. I paid more to XXXX XXXX in payments while that credit account was open than I ever charged to the card. The "" balance '' they are claiming I owe consists of only unfair and excessive fees imposed on the account by XXXX XXXX. None of that balance is reflective of money I had actually charged to the account. The ridiculous fees they added to my account was the only reason there was any "" balance '' remaining at all. They had me in a vicious cycle of repaying fees month after month and I was n't even paying for anything I had charged at all. This should not be allowed. I paid them much more than I ever truly owed them. I can document this with statements if needed. 

Fenton Law Firm sent me a letter last month requesting a settlement amount of XXXX. It was sent from XXXX XXXX and listed her email address. I attempted to email her directly to explain what I have explained about but did not get a response. I have emailed her XXXX times. I do not wish to have any communication with them that is not in writing so that it can all be documented. I feel like they did not respond to my initial emails on purpose so they would automatically win against me and have the judgment lien placed. I offered them in my email to settle this for XXXX just to have it taken care of, even though I feel this debt is completely unfair and unfounded. This collection account has been detrimental to my credit for years now and I ca n't repair my credit until I get this taken care of.

They informed me that they did not get the specs but they did not need them they were not covering the repair because an update on these parts was never done. I responded an update on the pistons and rings? you mean there was a recall on my engine that was never done? XXXX said not a recall an update.

As you will see in the documentation, Trans Union did not delete any records and responded that all were verified but they did not provide any documentation verifying my signature and provided no evidence of how it was verified. I then sent another letter on XX/XX/2016 to Trans Union to validate this information and provide me with copies of documentation associated with these accounts.

It was XXXX of those 24-month promotion loans with no interest, and if you do n't pay it off within 24 months they charge you back interest at the rate of 29.99 %. I made a mistake and thought the promotion period was 24 months, so I set up my account to pay Synchrony {$300.00} per month so I would have the loan paid off in full in 21 months ( Original loan amount {$6100.00} ). The other mistake I made was setting the auto pmt of {$300.00} and not checking my statements each month because, as it turns out, the promotional period was 18 months, not 24 months. I just discovered Synchrony posted a one-time interest charge of {$3300.00} to my account in XXXX, and has been charging me {$110.00} interest per month. While I am at fault, I just can not accept the fact that ( with 3 months left to pay on the loan ) a finance company would penalize someone like they did. I realize I signed off on the terms and conditions, but you can never fully realize the extend of the penalty until it happens. My complaint, really, is that Synchrony should be able to see my intent to pay off inside of XXXX months. Particularly since I have XXXX loans with them. XXXX loans were taken out around the same time and for the same amount. The other loan does have a XXXXmonth promotional period, and I was ( also ) paying {$300.00} per month on this other loan. Also, I 've gone through my emails ( since I have my statements set to e-delivery ) and I 'm not finding any emails from them alerting me to the end of the 18-month promotion period. What they did to me seems truly egregious and inhumane, even given the fact that I signed off of the terms. I have written and called the company, but so far have gotten nowhere with them. I 've been a loyal customer with Synchrony and their predecessor GE Capital. I 've never missed a payment and feel sick about not just what happened to me, but what they must be doing to other unexpecting customers. To me, a positive outcome in this situation would be for Synchrony to recognize my error ( thinking it was a 24-month promotion ) and retroactively adjust they terms to 24 months. If this loan was 24 months as I originally thought I would have the loan paid off next month. As it stands, I still owe them {$4300.00} due to all the interest charges since XXXX ... on an original loan of {$6100.00}. Seems unbelievable.",Consumer Loan

981841,"Credit Bureau : Equifax , Inc . 
Product : Equifax Complete Family Plan Amount Paid : {$270.00} Date Annual Subscription Paid : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Problem : My wife and I had identity theft in XXXX, when a fake tax return was filed to the IRS. The fake return included our social security numbers, birthdates and home address. We purchased the Equifax product listed above, with the primary purpose to get automatic fraud alerts placed every 90 days with the three primary credit bureaus. The service seemed to work fine, and I renewed our annual subscription on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for the amount of {$270.00}. The products dashboard showed "" green '' for "" Automatic Fraud Alerts '' being properly set for both myself and my wife. However, last week, on XXXX XXXX, I clicked on the settings for Auto Fraud Alerts, and I was disappointed to learn that Auto Fraud Alerts had an error, and the last fraud alert had been sent on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for my account, and had expired on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( prior to my renewal ). A screenshot is attached. A new fraud alert had never been set with Equifax or with XXXX or XXXX. The same was true for my wife. For all of XXXX, I had the false impression that Automatic Fraud Alert was on, because the dashboard was green. But the screenshot shows the alerts were not set. 

The primary reason I had purchased this product was to get the auto fraud alerts. On XXXX XXXX, I pulled my credit reports for all three bureaus, and confirmed that Fraud Alert had not been set by Equifax on any of the three credit reports. As a result, since this service is not delivering what it promises, I decided to cancel my subscription on XXXX XXXX. Equifax will cancel my subscription starting XXXX XXXX. They will not refund me the total amount. They will only refund me for the 4 unused months between XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

MY PROBLEM IS Equifax will not refund me for the full annual subscription amount I paid. I asked Equifax to provide me a full refund, because Equifax failed to deliver the Auto Fraud Alert service since the beginning of my current subscription. Equifax refuses to do so. They will only refund me for the amount of time remaining on my subscription until it expires. Even though they failed to deliver the Fraud Alert setting service since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, they refuse to refund me for the full amount, claiming "" they are unable to do so ''. It is unreasonable for Equifax to keep a portion of my subscription when it failed to deliver the primary service I wanted. 

I sent an email to their customer support on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and received a reply form Equifax on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating they can not refund for past service on my current subscription. The email told me to call an Equifax Customer Service number to discuss this request with customer service. Today, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke to an Equifax call center supervisor, and he told me he is unable to provide a refund for the past 8 months even though he acknowledged the product had n't delivered the service I was promised. Unbelievable! 

Bottom line, since Equifax did not deliver the Auto Fraud Alert at the start of the subscription, I want a full refund for the entire subscription, not a partial refund for the remaining unused subscription months. Equifax has failed to provide me the primary service I was seeking -- Automatic Fraud Alerts. Please help me get a full refund of the {$270.00} that I paid. 

Overall, my experience with Equifax has been very disappointing. They have lost me as a customer. My recommendation to consumers is to not waste your money buying their credit monitoring services.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

The modification extended the term of the loan from 30 to 40 years and reset the interest rate to the then current market rate for mortgage loans. There was no forgiveness of principal.

In XXXX my oldest son 's dad died. I was working 3 jobs to support my boys, teaching school, delivering pizza and part time as a receptionist and heard nothing further from the dealership. I believed the car had been sold years earlier since it was brand new when returned it in XXXX. 
Ten years later in XXXX I received a notice of a judgment in the mail that was filed from NEWMAN , MATHIS , BRADY & SPEDALE but I was never given an opportunity to present myself against these attorneys and XXXX XXXX XXXX in court. I had no idea I owed anything to anyone. 
I contacted the attorneys on the letter and explained that I had NEVER been given a notice to appear in court.They totally disregarded this and told me the FIRST judgment filing was filed in XXXX and they re-filed a SECOND time in XXXX. After adding thousands of dollars to a much smaller debt ( I never received any initial amount ) it became an astronomical sum. I tried when possible to pay {$50.00} a month on it but it was truly a struggle. Why they chose to not seek monies from my ex- husband who was also on the judgment since the beginning is a question I can not get answers to. 
My ex-husband died in XXXX. 
I assumed with his death in XXXX the release of the judgment would happen. I could not have been more mistaken. These attorneys Newman , Mathis , Brady & Spedale and XXXX XXXX XXXX chose to re- filed this judgment again for a THIRD time in XXXX against me and my deceased ex, which I did not even know was possible.It was then in the amount of over {$24000.00}. 
Again I called them and explained he had died and why after 20 years were they still harasing me over this.The car was returned in mint condition with only a couple of hundred miles on it if that and I am sure sold for nearly the amount we paid. If anything was owed I was never given a receipt of the sale of the car to see exactly what it was sold for but I am sure due to the excellent condition of the returned vehicle the full value was gotten for it. 
Today I got ( ATTACHED ) a notice of garnishment from these attorneys and the amount is over {$32000.00}. How can this happen? 
I know thousands of people who give cars back AFTER SOME KEEPING THEM YEARS BEFORE GIVING THEM BACK and they never hear another word nor does it ruin their credit. 
Why these attorneys are harassing me after 24 years is horrible. 
I have finally gotten thru those horrible years and yet I still can not put this behind me.I HAD JUST mailed them another {$50.00} check on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I just do not understand why they keep re-filing this joint judgment 3 times and now trying to garnish 25 % of my TAKE HOME pay. Please help me in getting this debt removed from my name so they can not garnish 25 % of my TAKE HOME pay after 24 years. 
This garnishment will put me back in the position I was in nearly 25 years ago and will cause me a grave hardship. Is n't ruining my credit for the last 24 years enough along with the stress this puts me under for a debt that was my ex- husband 's? 
I want to file a formal complaint against these attorneys and XXXX XXXX XXXX for undue harassment and respectfully request this judgment be nullified and that I receive no further communication from either of these companies. The monies already paid over these 24 years they can keep.I just want to be free of these attorneys ' constant letters and phone calls.

However, they tell me I have to pay them all the late payments at once or they will auction my home. I live here with my wife and XXXX children and I do not want this to happen. 

I bought my home in XXXX and completed an FHA streamline refinance through Quicken Loans in XXXX. In XXXX XXXX my wife was pregnant and she saw a large snake in our house. She was very scared and essentially refused to live in the house because she was scared for the baby and for our other small child. So we had to move out of our home and stay at my mother 's house for XXXX months. I had to pay my mother rent, as well as pay the utilities and mortgage payment on our home. A couple of months later I began falling behind on the mortgage payment. My wife insisted that I hire people to come out and clean out the entire house and treat it with reptile repellent. This was expensive and it took a while to get this done. 

Shortly after I began missing payments I tried to start the review process with Quicken Loans. I was assigned a case manager but I was rarely able to speak with this person, and instead talked to other workers who were not knowledgeable. This went round and round for XXXX months -- I would be told I am now in review with the underwriter, then I find out a couple of months later that the review was not completed because of this or that document and now we need to start over. 

This is not acceptable. We have moved back into our house, so the hardship has passed. I am gainfully employed and can afford a fair mortgage payment. However Quicken Loans has not given me any options other than full reinstatement, which I am not able to do.",Mortgage

Neither my husband nor I, his wife, authorized or used his card to complete these transactions. No one else has permission to use our joint accounts. 
Because we had our checking account set up with overdraft protection, and the criminal called the bank and requested a one day spending limit to be raised to {$10000.00}, and the bank granted the request!, they spent all the money in our checking and then our savings account continued to cover the spending until less than {$200.00} remained.

XXXX XXXX filed a fraud claim and told us we would get our money back in 3 to 4 days. It never happened. I went to the bank again on XX/XX/XXXX.

At this time, I called Citi and explained the problem, as well as my concern that the card would not arrive in time for me to make the spend within 2 months. I was assured that there were notations on my account detailing the extreme difficulty I had in simply obtaining the card. Ultimately, they re-sent the card & PIN, & I drove 20 minutes each way to the XXXX facility and received by card & PIN. I proceeded to meet the requirements in the 2 successive months after receiving my card & PIN. 

Since meeting the requirements I have been told on multiple occasions that I met the requirements, and that I simply needed to wait a designated time before the miles would be issued. After it became clear that Citi was dragging their feet on the issue, I began documenting my phone calls. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called and spoke with "" XXXX , '' who personally verified that I met the requirements, & stated that the promotion code was noted on file. He said "" I do n't know why it has been delayed, but it should be issued soon. It is probably delayed because of the billing cycle. '' He told me that XXXX miles would definitely be awarded by the end of XXXX. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called and spoke with another representative who again confirmed I met the requirements, & provided me with a reference number in case there was any other problem. She also told me that the case was being in some way prioritized, that I would receive a secure message within 72 hours & provided an access code for the message. No message was received. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/16, after receiving another bill and still no response regarding the reward miles, I called yet another representative, XXXX . I stated that I had upheld my end of the bargain, but I felt like Citi had not. Further, they had not met the deadlines they set for themselves in previous conversations with me on XXXX accounts. I had been charged $ XXXX/month for having the account open while they decided if they should uphold the promise they made when I opened the account. The representative, XXXX, agreed to credit my account with {$60.00} for the last two months ' fees, as well as waive the next month 's {$30.00} fee. 
-On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received notification that Citi was denying me the miles because I had not completed the spend in the timeframe they designated. There was no mention of any of the aforementioned problems, conversations, or promises. 

My entire experience with this Citi promotion has been frustrating, time-consuming, and not worth it. They have not upheld the promises they made, they have not met the timelines they set, and finally they have not credited me with the reward they offered.",Bank account or service
525215,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Chase ( NMLS ID : XXXX ) Mortgage banker XXXX XXXX ( NMLS ID : XXXX ) approached me and offered me a loan with No point, No fee, XXXX ARM 3.375 % interest rate to refinance the mortgage loan on our investment property ( refer to the loan application form, the subject property address for the loan is my investment property ). She told me that a cash-out refinancing to a loan amount of {$410000.00} would be necessary in order to get the interest rate of 3.375 %. Since the deal offered by XXXX was better than what other loan brokers had offered me, I re-confirmed all the terms with XXXX again and decided to accept her offer. I then submitted my loan application, along with all the requested documentation, to Chase bank through XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. She emphasized that the rate and price could only be promised until Monday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. And I was also told the refinancing process would take about 45-60 days. So a mutual agreement about the rate and terms on the mortgage application has been established on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
After receiving the loan disclosures dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from Chase, we went in XXXX office to sign all documentation from the package on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. We did clearly question why the float rate option on Lock-in Agreement had been checked if the rate lock had previously been done. XXXX simply told us to ignore it. Moreover, we also pointed out there was an {$8800.00} fee charge listed on the GFE dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Again, XXXX simply told us to ignore it and do n't worry about it. She told us Chase bank will refund all the fees at closing since this is a NO Point, NO Fee refinance loan. 
The fact is XXXX did n't lock the rate for our loan on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. She locked the rate on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instead. From the GFE dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, there is also XXXX point fee charge against the original NO Point, NO Fee she offered to us. 
We, as Borrowers, had absolutely no idea why the rate lock was performed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On the other hand, our understanding was that the rate had been locked on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the loan documentations would be ready for signing by end of last XXXX. ( We had been told several times by XXXX while we checking the loan status with her during XXXX XXXX. ) After we received the GFE dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we contacted XXXX XXXX and pointed out the discrepancy and the fees, and questioned her. Her answer is still the same : just ignore it and do n't worry about it. 
In XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX suddenly started to avoid responding to my inquiries about the loan status. I had to seek assistance from XXXX assistant, XXXX, and the Chase loan processor myself in order to keep the loan process going and hope the loan could be funded before the rate lock expired on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
Unfortunately, XXXX kept delaying the loan process and refused to make corrections to the extra fee charge, the loan was unable to be funded before XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and expired, which incurred an additional XXXX point of fee charge to the loan. 
During the entire loan application period, we, as Borrowers, have submitted the required documentation to Chase in time and never delayed anything along the loan process. We have kept all the email communication between XXXX and us to prove this point. The documentation requested from Mortgage Commitment Letter ( dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) was submitted to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
XXXX locked the rate on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and found out a fee charge of 2.5 %. According to XXXX, she reported to her Lending Manager, XXXX ( NMLS ID : XXXX ), immediately and requested to remove the fee charge. But nothing had been done by XXXX at all ; thus the loan was unable to get funded by rate lock expiration date on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which further caused an extra 0.5 % fee charge to this loan. Chase bank side is fully responsible for this charge. 
As of today, there are total of XXXX points of fee charge on this loan.",Mortgage

After wasting several minutes of my time, and waiting for several machines to spew out irrelevant garbage, someone finally came on the line. However, this person also asked me for my nonexistent credit card number, then referred me to another person who did nothing to restore my access. The second person could not be understood clearly. The connection was poor and she had an accent. She asked me some XXXX questions about pet insurance ( which I used to have but do not presently ), then announced that she needed to change my password and would send me information to my home phone. Since I am hundreds of miles from my home phone, I explained to her that this was pointless and asked her to stop wasting my time. She then announced that she would not grant me access to my account for "" security '' reasons. Let me clear here. The problem with this dysfunctional system is that there is no person at JP Morgan who is accountable for these problems and various other people who want non-existent credit and debit card numbers go through irrelevant routines when people are arbitrarily but routinely denied access to their money. 

This has been the situation on my accounts for years. JP Morgan is unaccountable for ensuring that online banking is reliably available instead of intermittently so. 

I have bills to pay and need to check which checks have cleared. But I can not do so with the abusive and deceptive practices of JP Morgan.",Checking or savings account
537653,"Not only once, but twice i was told by Wells Fargo Bank that they could not help me out at all unless i was defaulted on my loan. The first time my husband was going to be unemployed for a short while, i had called in to let them know that i may be a little short on money the following month since we would be going without his paychecks and asked if there was some kind of payment arrangement that we could make. The person on the phone told me that they could not make any arrangements to help me unless i was at least 90 days past due on my mortgage. 
The second time, my husband was fearing for a layoff from his company because rumors were going around that they were going to be conducting layoffs. Around the same time he received a phone call from a company back east requesting that he come to work for them. In fearing for him losing his job he took the job offer and we moved out east. We put my house up for sale XX/XX/XXXX, and i called into Wells Fargo again. Again i was told that there was nothing that they could do to help me with my mortgage unless i was 90 days past due. I remember arguing with them asking them why they would n't want to help a customer who has never missed a mortgage payment instead of already putting them in a bad situation before they could help. Now it is over a year later, my husband and i have had a buyer interested since XX/XX/XXXX and we have still not sold our house. Our house is still in the short sale program, after being kicked out and sent into forclosure until i called repeatedly about it they put it back in short sale status. I have had over XXXX "" case representatives '' assigned to my case in a year, i never hear from anyone, and the only time i hear from anyone is when i post negative remarks on twitter ( i can count on hearing from someone from wells fargo within 24 hours. ) Every time we submit paperwork, they say they have it and then a week or a month later they tell us they need the SAME paper that they just said they HAD! and now since i defaulted on my loan so that i could go into the short sale program as instructed by wells fargo ( since they would not help me unless i defaulted on my loan ) i can do nothing for the buyer who is so desperately wanting to get into my home. at this point the buyer is offering to pay more than what i owe on the home, but since there are penalties and late fee charges for not paying on my mortgage, i can not take a loan to pay the balance of the mortgage and just sell outright to this buyer, because i would not have enough to pay the penalties and late charges. Please help and make people aware that wells fargo prefers foreclosures over short-sales. They do not offer any help until you are 3 payments behind because it is so HARD to get back from a situation like this. They know what they are doing and what they are doing is wrong!

There is a new rule that states if there is a co-signer on a loan who made payments for 12 months and you can show that proof then this amount is not factored into your debt to income ratio. It is a very important step in the mortgage process especially for a first time home buyer with student loan debt. When I called  Navient the first time for thi s payment history ( since there is no way to obtain this information in my online account ) they were wrong  about my payment history and in fact could not tell me who paid my loans.

XXXX XXXX AND XXXX XXXX ARE ACCESSORIES/ACCOMPLICES TO ALL CRIMES LISTED ABOVE. 
RACKETEERING ~ NATIONSTAR has connected with the most corrupt people in the industry and they have created and inflated a giant, fraudulent company that focuses on illegal home theft using the false illusion of service as a cover for the crimes. The false need for their services is created during the loan origination process and it expands into a huge racket. This scam has a sophisticated XXXX tier system. First, the originator of the loan makes an intentional error on origination which later causes the payments to skyrocket. They claim inadvertent but it happens consistently, not rarely or occasionally. This initial fraud drives the home into default and eventually into foreclosure as part of an investment strategy to seize homes and defraud taxpayers, Insurance companies and government insurance, primarily FHA. Harvest season is XXXX. They send a statement with unwarranted fees plus an increase in escrow to shock Holiday weary and cash strapped homeowners into running away from a home they can no longer afford. Weak companies like XXXX pick the low hanging fruit and commit a good portion of the crime with intentional escrow fraud and non existent customer service when it is time to correct. When they get a home into severe default that becomes NationStar 's specialty. They have the entire network so they write their own rules. They have violated so many laws along the way that, today, they simply auction off the homes occupied, collect on the FHA and PMI insurance, and leave a local dispute and resentment in every city in the U.S. as new owners evict unsuspecting victims. The entore racket is created by fraud. If the loans were written honestly and the escrow was handled correctly there would be no need for a maintenance company, inspecton company, title company, mortgage company, online property auction companies or any other service Nationstar Holdings LLC has under their umbrella. Every summer the foreclosure listings spike, now I know why. It 's the XXXX fraud that creates summer listings. They dry up in te fall and a new batch will be illegally picked next year using fraud. 
EXTORTION ~ Instead of correcting, helping, complying and servicing the loan as required by law, NationStar specializes in lies, manipulation, fraud, misleading consumers about the laws and their legal rights, and pencil whips foreclosures for the banks as part of the larger racketeering scam everyone profits from. In this case payments were never right because fraud occurred on day one and never stopped, Nationstar has known about this since last summer because WE FORCED THEM to answer. They would have never helped or been honest, ever. Even though WE KNOW AND HAVE PROVEN a crime has occurred they continue to collect and demand money that is not owed, and the consumer has no choice but to pay the criminals. This extortion also depletes any legal fund a consumer may have. They stall and slowly bleed the consumers, messing with them, toying with them, having fun and laughing every step of the way as they operate with perceived immunity. 
WIRE FRAUD ~ They have crossed every state line and used every form of communication with lies ad fraud in every channel, every where. 
MISLEADING CONSUMERS ~ It starts on loan origination and it never stops. The honesty in this organization is almost zero. 
FAILURE TO MAIL MONTHLY STATEMENTS ~ We have not received a single monthly statement in 2016 but we have been threatened with foreclosure.

876251,"I have been dealing with a fraud case on my Macys account for over a year and a half now. From the beginning Macys has proved to be completely incompetent in taking care of it. There has been so much stress surrounding this and I have gotten nowhere in dealing with them directly. I did not keep track of all the dates I called at the very beginning because I had no idea that I would need to. Luckily I have saved all correspondence, and started documenting everything pretty early on. The following is a timeline : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I received a letter from Macys stating that my credit limit had been decreased. This made no sense to me because I had only ever used the card 2 times since getting it and paid the balance immediately. It had been close to a year since I had used it last. I called the company and sure enough there were about {$800.00} worth of charges on the account on expensive items like coach purses, channel makeup, and name brand clothing. I stated that I did not make these charges, and I was given the phone number to start a fraud investigation. **I dont have the exact date but sometime in the beginning of XXXX XXXX I called the XXXX XXXX police department and filed a police report. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I received a letter from the fraud investigation department at Macys requesting that I complete the enclosed form. Aside from filing the police report, this was all I needed to do on my end for the fraud investigation. I completed the form and sent it back to Macys. **In the next couple months I started receiving multiple phone calls a day from Macys collections. I would call ( wait on hold for at least 15mins ) and explain that this is a fraud case and its under investigation. They would apologize and put a hold on the phone calls. I would have a temporary break from the calls, but after a week or so they would start again. I would then have to call and wait, and explain everything again. This happened at least 5 times. **After a couple months of hearing nothing from the fraud department, I called them to check the status of everything. I was told that it would be taken care of shortly and to give it a couple weeks. **I gave it a couple weeks with still no word from the fraud department, while still receiving daily phone calls from the collections department. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : This is when I started documenting my phone calls. I called the fraud department, again, and was told that my case would be expedited, and to give it another month. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I received a letter in the mail from a collections agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX, requesting I pay the charges on my Macys account XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I returned the letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX, stating that the charges are not mine. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I received in the mail a letter from Macys. It was the very same letter that was sent to me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX asking me to complete the enclosed form to begin the fraud investigation. I called the fraud department and asked to speak to the supervisor. His name was XXXX, and he said he would expedite the case and it would take approximately 2 weeks to be taken care of. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I received the letter I had been waiting for, for 4 months! A letter from Macys fraud investigation department that stated the following ; We completed the investigation on your Macys Credit Card account. As a result, we removed the disputed charges and any related fees and interest charges from your account. And most importantly, We updated your dispute to a resolved status with the consumer reporting agencies listed below ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) and the agencies were informed to update your credit report. Please allow them at least 60 days to revise their records. **Naturally, I was relieved and a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. A whole year went by without me ever really thinking about this again. It wasnt until I tried to apply for a travel credit card in early XXXX XXXX and got denied, that I found out that the letter Macys had sent was a complete lie. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called Macys fraud department and spoke with XXXX. He was confused about the situation at first but after speaking with his supervisor, he said it looked like everything had been taken care of and resolved as fraud but the final step of closing the account and sending the update to the credit bureaus had never happened. He stated that he reopened the case and notated to contact the credit bureaus and updated them of the resolved status. **I also filed a dispute with XXXX at this time about this account. To which I later found out on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX after speaking with a representative at XXXX that Macys had responded to their dispute on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that the charges should remain on my credit report. *This is the point where I start to question if this is even legal anymore. ** A couple months went by of me assuming that things had been taken care of after speaking with XXXX and filing the dispute with XXXX. It wasnt until XXXX XXXX, while trying to consolidate my student loans, I got denied because I had a charge off balance on my credit report from Macys, that I realized that nothing had been taken care of. So now, these fraudulent charges that were, according to Macys, cleared from my account and updated to a resolved status, are sitting on my credit report as a charge off balance. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called XXXX fraud department and spoke with XXXX. She apologized for all of this, expedited my case with her supervisor, gave me my claims #, and told me it would take 7-14 business days to clear the balance and to check back on XXXX. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called Macys fraud department and was told that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX after my phone call, my information was forwarded to the credit bureaus and they were informed that the balance was not mine. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called XXXX to confirm what Macys had told me the day before. They said that the information was still on my credit report and they had received nothing from Macys. She also told me that if I had the original letter from Macys updating my account to a resolved status I could send it directly to them and they could take care of it for me. ** When I got off the phone with her I realized that the account number I have relating to all the fraud correspondence with Macys ( a 12 digit number ) is different than the account number on my credit report ( a 16 digit number ). However, I have only ever had 1 account with Macys. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called Macys customer service to ask about the account numbers and if I could receive something that showed that they were the same account. The lady from customer service didnt understand my question, so I asked to speak with a supervisor. She placed me on hold for approximately 30 minutes and returned to say that no one could find the supervisor and to call back in an hour. Instead, I called Macys fraud department again. I spoke with XXXX and updated her on my situation ; she was very apologetic and put me on hold while she got a hold of her supervisor. After about 10 minutes on hold, the call was disconnected. I called back immediately, and then spoke with XXXX. I updated her and she said she would try to find her supervisor, but no one knew where she was. She asked me if I would call back and I said no, I wanted to speak to the supervisor no matter how long I had to wait. For the next hour or so, I spoke with XXXX. She explained to me that the reason the account numbers were different was because of something called a legacy account. Apparently all the old 12-digit account numbers were switched to 16-digit account numbers when their operating system had changed, and the 2 different numbers represented the same account. In that case, it seemed simple to just ask for something in writing from them stating that the accounts were the same, as to prevent any confusion when submitting my documents to the credit bureaus. XXXX said anything in writing needed to go through their legal department first, but she could give me something that was already pre-written. She emailed me their standard mortgage letter that referenced both accounts. I was not pleased with this because the mortgage letter states that the account is under the investigation for fraud, and my investigation was suppose to have been resolved over a year ago. Again she stated this was the only documentation she could give me that showed that the accounts were the same and that as long as I had both letters it shouldnt be a problem. She then tried to get off the phone with me and I said I would still like to speak with a supervisor, because while I planned on taking care of things on my end, I still needed to ensure that they were taking care of things on their end. Her response to me was that since my account had been sitting untouched for so long, Citibank now owned it ( this was the first I had heard of this ). So it wasnt as simple of a process as it may seem and that getting the account back from Citibank would be like pulling teeth because it had to go through so many people, and it wasnt until they had it back that they could re-open it and clear the charges. Naturally, this response infuriated me. The reason my account has been sitting untouched for so long is because Macys informed me it was resolved and updated with the consumer reporting agencies, when in fact, that never happened. It was their negligence that put it there, so it should be their job to get it out. I then asked her why I was told 2 days earlier by someone in their office that my information had been forwarded to the credit bureaus when it clearly hadnt been, and if that was just a flat out lie. Her response, I dont know how to answer that. I was finally able to speak to the supervisor, XXXX XXXX. She apologized for everything and ensured that everything was in her hands now and would be worked on and taken care of. She said that she would speak to their legal department and get me the same letter that was sent to me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with the new and updated account number, and it would take 3-5 business days. In the mean time they were in the middle of the process of getting my account back from Citibank so they could clear the charges and close it and update it with the credit bureaus. She also gave me her direct phone number to really ensure me that she would be taking care of this personally. That evening I faxed over the original letter from Macys sent on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, along with the mortgage letter sent to me that day, linking the accounts, and an explanation of the 2, to XXXX. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I received a letter from XXXX stating that the Macys charges had been deleted from my credit report, based on the information I sent them. ** I then realized this only applied to TransUnion and I would need to submit the same documents to the other credit bureaus. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : As referenced earlier, I spoke with a representative from XXXX to file a dispute and submit my supporting documents. She opened up a new dispute case, but mentioned that they had already disputed this back in XXXX. At that time I had not provided my supporting documents, I didnt think I needed to. It was at this time I was told that Macys had responded to them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that the charges should remain on my credit report. I re-disputed it with XXXX and sent over the same documents I sent to XXXX. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I decided to call the supervisor from Macys fraud department, XXXX XXXX, that I had spoken with 2 weeks earlier to ask why Macys would have told the credit bureaus to keep the charges on my account, to get an update on what had been taking place the past couple of weeks to resolve this, and to follow up about the letter she was supposed to send to me after clearing it with the legal department with the correct account information. I called the number she had given me that she had stated was her direct line, and it was a number that had been disconnected. At this point, I realized that it would be of no benefit to communicate with Macys fraud department any further. Their practices seem extremely unethical and dont seem to be legal.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

On XX/XX/XXXX I faxed my supporting documents ( attached, pages XXXX ) with the cover letter explanation ( attached, page XXXX ) to Barclaycard.

Obviously, the credit was done when they opened the dispute ( for the wrong amount ) and reversal when they closed it. 

Same day, I called the Barclaycard and spoke with XXXX. XXXX told me that my case was closed and the charge of {$390.00} was applied correctly. I asked her to pull my fax ( attached, pages XXXX ) and we read it out loud together, to verify that the issue was for a missing credit of {$180.00}, not {$390.00}.

XXXX went to talk to someone a few times during our conversation. Finally she said that IF I wanted to open a new case, I needed to submit the documents. I told her that I want to continue with my original case for a missing credit of {$180.00}, and she told me that my case was closed. I told her that I never opened the case for {$390.00}. I asked her how can I appeal it, and she said there is no appeal process.

Capital One is stating that the report is correct and I should have never received the hardship, they waited till after the hardship period and went back and reported my account delinquent for the entire period of the hardship. Their unfair credit reporting practices have impacted my credit score with all credit reporting agencies, creditors, lenders to the point, I can not obtain financing to consolidate my debt. I spoke with a supervisor at Capital One, XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/18 after speaking with the credit bureau which they informed me that Capital One stated the reporting was correct. This is incorrect, because I was given a hardship and told no payment as due. XXXX XXXX confirmed I was placed on a hardship due to the nature of events. Under the circumstance, she did not understand why Capital One had reported my payments as late, she further went and stated that the late reporting had been deferred during this period, and when the hardship ended, and I should not have been given the hardship. She stated that my account was delinquent from the month before, but my payment is not 30 days late at the time of the natural disaster. I called Capital One and informed them of my situation prior to the end that payment period. I was told no payment was due, and my account would be deferred for 90 days. Capital One reported my account as late for 3 months. Again, this has created a hardship for my self and my family. I realized that I have made payments days late in the past and I was charged a late fee for doing so, but not past 30 days which would have resulted in impacting my credit report. Again, these are unfair credit practices and reporting. If Capital One did not want to honor the hardship offered to me, then perhaps they should have told me and I would have made other arrangement to ensure they were paid timely. They offered a service and reneged on it, without informing me or advising me of there intent to do so. The had no reason and no right to report my credit as late for 3 months, since I was told by Capital One employees on several phone calls that no payment was due. The only fair resolution to this issue would like to se is for Capital One to fix this error, and report to the credit bureau that my account was current for the 3 months, they falsely reported as delinquent during a state of emergency, which a moratorium had already been established by the Governor of the State of Florida.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

901670,"Here is the information provided by your organization regarding inquires : An inquiry refers to a request to look at your credit file, and it generally falls into one of two types : Hard inquiries. These are typically inquiries by lenders after you apply for credit. These inquiries will impact your credit score because most credit scoring models look at how recently and how frequently you apply for credit.
Soft inquiries. These are reviews of your credit file, including reviews of existing accounts by lenders, prescreening inquiries by prospective lenders, and your requests for your annual credit report. These will not change your credit score.
This is the definition of the two types of inquiries used consistently when researching about the impact of inquiries on credit scores. I am concerned that Navy Federal Credit Union does a hard inquiry on credit reports when changes are requested on existing accounts such as credit limit increases. This practice has a negative impact on credit scores for an extensive amount of time ( 2 years ) and is n't a fair practice for consumers. A credit limit increase is typically not considered a new application by most financial institutions and should not be viewed as such.

This communication is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used that purpose. However, to the extent your original obligation was discharged or is subject to an automatic stay of bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code, this notice is for compliance with non-bankruptcy law and/or informational purposes only and does not constitute an attempt to collect a debt or to impose personal liability for such obligation. Nothing in this letter ( including our use of the words "" your, '' "" loan, '' mortgage, '' or "" account '' ) means that you 're required to repay a debt that 's been discharged. Any payment you make on the account is voluntary, but we may still have rights under the security instrument, including the right to foreclose on the property.

This is deceptive due to the fact that many attempts where made on the behalf of the Plaintiffs to removed the debt with offer ( s ) to pay, accepted for value return for value aka discharge and a bond money order which was not rejected in writing nor in explanation with a legal notarized document with agent or officer signature explanation as to why or why not offers where not excepted within the legal bylaws UCC laws etc, .. 
Definition - Acceptance for Value is a remedy available only in commercial law ( the Uniform Commercial Code or UCC ). One can accept for value ONLY a commercial instrument that has been issued for value, that is when 1. ) the instrument has been issued to generate value where there is NO prior value ; AND when 2. ) the instrument ( such as a bill or a charge ) has NO signed contract to back it up. 
In short, an instrument issued for value is an OFFER TO CONTRACT from someone ( the ISSUER ), unbacked by a pre-existing, written contract, in which that person is attempting to get YOU to give value to that instrument by having you falsely believe that you owe money when you, in fact, owe nothing. HOW you respond, determines whether YOU or the ISSUER becomes liable for the amount claimed. If you ignore the offer ( and therefore dishonor the person making the offer ) or give it a blank endorsement ( with your signature only ), you have assumed liability for the amount specified. However, if you give the instrument a qualified endorsement or conditional acceptance ( by accepting it for value ), you have, in fact, made a counteroffer, and kept yourself in honor by responding to the original offer, and thereby kept the liability on the ISSUER. In the case of a bill sent to you, your qualified endorsement via accepted for value keeps the ISSUER liable for the money claimed NOT you! You retain your status as the creditor in the situation, and it is up to YOU whether that instrument ( the bill or charge you received ) becomes a negotiable instrument ( money ) with which you can settle the account. You can either accept for value, placing all liability for payment on the original issuer ; OR you can accept for value and then specify that the money will be paid using the money created by your government bond created by your Birth Certificate under the emergency laws enacted following the bankruptcy of the U.S. in 1933. ( Note : In the bankruptcy of 1933 the U.S. government took ownership of all land and possessions of the American people, including the people themselves as surety for further loans from the Federal Reserve and the international bankers. Under the legal TRUST created by the U.S. Constitution, such a taking action would have been outright theft and fraud, so the government was required to offer a remedy to the people, as the beneficiaries of that TRUST, in order to exercise their rights, if they so choose. ) Since the issuer had NO signed, written contract to back his claim, he was forced to issue for value ( i.e., issue it in an attempt to create value ) his instrument ( whether a bill, legal indictment, traffic ticket or other violation of a statute, any demand for payment, or whatever ). In essence, the issuer is throwing you a hot potato and is hoping you will be ignorant enough to simply accept the instrument as a contract offer as it is ; and give it value by ignoring it or by your blank endorsement ; and to thereby accept the liability for paying it. If you accept it for value and return it for value, you have tossed him back the hot potato in the form of a counteroffer, so that he ( the issuer ) becomes liable for the amount of money specified in his original instruments claim, unbacked by any pre-existing contract. 
Consequently, the instrument issued pays the instrument! The original issuer pays the original issue he pays himself. Therefore, the transaction is balanced to zero and closed. 
Of note : In ALL penal actions for violations of STATUTES, the national debt is the PRESUMED preexisting contract, for purchase, that influences the conscience of the judge in making his decisions. Since under the Laws of XXXX and the Natural Law ( derived from XXXX Law ), ALL men are equal in authority. Therefore, no man or body of men can legitimately coerce or force another man to do something against his wishes and will! Consequently, under the Common Law, and international commercial law, NO man can be forced into a contract against his wishes, AND there must be equal consideration ( things of equal VALUE ) exchanged between the parties, with full disclosure of information, in order for a contract to be valid. It appears that today, few Americans realize that under long-standing international law, ALL legislated STATUTES or ACTS by any legislative body are mere OFFERS TO CONTRACT, which any individual man has the right to accept or refuse, as he wishes. One must remember that since 1933, ALL statutes ( legislated laws ) in the U.S. exist to pay back the national debt of the U.S. to the Federal Reserve banks and other U.S. creditors and they want you to agree and consent to be liable for this debt! Therefore, if a district attorney issues an information ( similar to an indictment, but not requiring a grand jury ) to you charging you with a crime, you have three choices regarding his offer to contract. First, you can IGNORE it, in which case you are in dishonor and assume liability for payment in either money or service in prison to repay the national debt. Second, you can SIGN it without conditions ( called an unqualified endorsement or blank endorsement ), then you have created a negotiable instrument by giving it value and have assumed liability for paying it, which can then be enforced by the issuer ( the district attorney as the government ) to help pay off the national debt. OR third, you can sign the information with a qualified endorsement using accept for value ( a  counteroffer ), by which you give that instrument a monetary value, but keep the liability for paying it on the ISSUER. So, in the case of legal charges against you by a district attorney or a court clerk ( usually by a traffic ticket issued by a police officer ), through an accept for value endorsement you have avoided all liability ; and kept the liability for payment ( as money and/or a prison sentence ) on the district attorney and/or court clerk it is then, THEY who need to pay the fine or fulfill the imposed prison sentence for that statute violation ; NOT you, since you did not accept liability. They tossed a hot potato to you and expected you to pay. But since they had NO signed, written contract in which you agreed to obey that particular statute, they were required under U.C.C. commercial law to issue that document for value that is, to issue it in the hope that YOU would give it value AND take liability for paying it by accepting it without any qualifications. However, by your accept for value qualified endorsement, you agreed to it and gave it its value, but declined to accept liability for payment. Then by returning the instrument ( the charges against you ), you tossed the hot potato back to them and kept THEM liable for any payments! This system may sound INSANE, but this is how the financial and legal system was set up following the 1933 bankruptcy of the U.S., along with the amended extensions of national emergency of 1917 and 1933. When you go to court, you go to a legislative-statutory court in essence, a Maritime-Admiralty court operating under the UCC bankruptcy code whose sole purpose is to fund the national debt NOT into a true judicial court. You are PRESUMED guilty and are subject to a summary judgment without any trial by jury, unless you simultaneously convene your OWN court-of-record under the Common Law within that courtroom. And that system is still in effect today within the U.S.

Any account that is past the statute of limitations and can not be deemed collectable must not be re-aged to ca use credit score anomalies as to cause forced 'account reviews ' to trigger a credit score o r report to be provided to existing creditors to allow reductions in credit lines is willful and intentional and in violation of FDCPA  1691e whe n acknowledging previous deleted material to resurface on the credit report to re-age, and plunger individual credit scores.     Such acts and practices are to be deemed intentional if the consumer shows willful and deliberate acts or practices the agency shares exclusive information when items especially negative items surface on the report to engage in fraudulent information sharing via credit reporting device or similar communication as 'triggering events ' to alert creditors.     Further, doing so would violate the integrity rule when the agency fails to follow proper security and steps to avoid re-aging accounts and causing reductions in credit scores without properly verifying account related information, previous account history and reporting.     Generally, when an account is written off the credit scores rebound, however when an account is written off, sold to another lender and reported as a new account this is called "" account re-aging '' and is illegal under the law.

The agent I spoke with today XXXX/XXXX/2016 at about XXXX XXXX was named XXXX and her employee ID is # XXXX, she was as helpful and understanding as possible but indicated her supervisor would only authorize XXXX refund of {$21.00} not both charges. If these charges were valid, they would not reverse any of it, so it is clear to me they acknowledge I did in fact cancel the billing as I described, it is in essence them asking for me to pay for their mistake which is unfair. 
Further, when I called it was at first explained to me that the {$39.00} alone gave me access to my credit information for 180 days. Then during the call I got an email regarding downgrading which I did not request. Then later in the call the agent, XXXX informed me that I only had paid for 30 days of access.

I applied for a student loan ( private ) and it was denied because the XXXX that was issue by the United States Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) was not sufficient for the financial institution to proof my permanent resident status. 

I am in the process of renewing my expired XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX ( expired on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) and have received multiple extensions to my XXXX from the DHS - United States XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) since then ; in other words, I have not interrupted my resident status since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I got it for the first time but unfortunately for me, the XXXX field office where my case is assigned to has a significantly large backlog.

Back in the month of XXXX, 2014, my wife XXXX XXXX and I applied for a mortgage loan with Wells Fargo Bank. Initially my wife and I were included on the loan application for the purchase of the XXXX XXXX XXXX property. However, the loan agent recommended that the loan should be in my name since it was questionable about the loan being approved with both my wife and I. Therefore, we accepted his advice and moved forward with me as the loan applicant for the purchasing of the house. The agent was working with my wife on my behalf to handle all the necessary paperwork to make the purchasing of XXXX XXXX XXXX property become a reality. The house for purchase was a XXXX house which needed to be rehab. Wells Fargo requested that we have to have this house inspected by a company which they must approve and that the company must be authorized to supervise and sign off on rehab work. My wife and I paid {$800.00} to get the inspection done with a company Wells Fargo had approved for the inspection. 
After the inspection was done and we found out that the roof repair estimation was incorrect because it was for a shingle roof instead of a slate roof. We paid a roof specialist {$250.00} to inspect the slate roof and received a more accurately amount of cost to repair the slate roof or change it to a shingle roof. My wife had forward this information to XXXX XXXX by email since she was working with him on getting all the necessary paperwork done in a timely matter. He had conveyed to her over the telephone that he suggests that we let the house go and my wife informed him that we would like to still proceed with purchasing house.

And yet be that as it may, out of the XXXX Credit Bureau 's, historically ( even though it is rarely brought up ), the Bureau with the WORST Database has always been XXXX! I simply had to laugh when I even read the first page a couple years ago and the addresses that were listed as addresses in which creditors would view that attested to where I have lived since maybe 1985, if they were n't actually used as a source of reference would cause anyone to simply just laugh. It is so obvious that ( and I have no idea what we are paying these people ) that there has NEVER been a time when Equifax actually attempted to at least set up within the fixed fields, what types of even characters would ever be there and simply start with that. Second, because this was dealing with the physical addresses of the consumer that it would EVER occur to anyone with the Federal Gov't Regulatory Agencies so suggest that they request copies of what was supposed to be identical data that made up these fixed fields and so the logical conclusion is that the data should either match or be pretty close. But NOOOO!. The government, which has become the arbiter of creating unethical conflict of interest exceptions which allow for these protected Credit Bureau 's to create products and sell this vaporware ( monitoring nothing subscription ) to the public. Now outside the beltway. those of us who remain that have not drank the kool-aid and completely sold out to the point where the term "" conflict of interest '', or "" unethical '' has no point of reference because the basis for any Standard was determined to be unconstitutional. In addition, Equifax who holds the golden trophy for possessing the most inaccurate database of any of the other XXXX, is the credit bureau of choice for most of those that extend credit. In addition, the appearance that a consumer can easily make changes just to their personal data so it is at least accurate and verifiable is fruitless. Once the changes are made, the consumer hits enter and is kicked out for any number of reasons. Primarily they use that due to security and lack of activity, the consumer has been timed out. Once that happens multiple times, you just give up. I have NEVER been able to reach a human to lodge a complaint or seek assistance, however, XXXX XXXX made all of my corrections and yet these so called bogus "" credit agencies '' which are simply a cover for the industry they represent continue to use them thus producing totally incorrect conclusions.",Credit reporting
710762,"My payday loan was for {$600.00}. However repaying of this {$600.00} cost a total of {$2500.00} including the repayment of the principal amount. I was not fully aware of the extremely high interest. I thought I could repay the loan off early, however Big Picture Loans does not make the process of repaying your loan off early easy. It is very difficult as they only offer a repayment every 2 week cycle which allows them to earn more interest. I would not do business with them again or recommend them to anyone. Repayment fees are at an unbelievable level",Payday loan

361231,"I received a pre-paid debit card that was serviced by the Citi Pre Paid Program. Unfortunately, due to a financial hardship and in the midst of moving to a new house, I misplaced my card. When I recently found it, the card had expired. Citi refuses access to the funds or send me a new card because they say the card has expired. I do not think that is right or fair. I would be ok if they charge a monthly inactivity fee but at least return the remaining funds to a hard working individual consumer who lives from paycheck to paycheck. Thank you.",Prepaid card
887028,"I was out of work for a few months in XXXX. I contacted Bank of America to inform them of the issue. Still out of work, I chose to use a credit card to make my mortgage payment. After a couple months of doing this and seeing my debt rapidly increase, I stopped using my credit card. I regained full time employment in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Bank of America to inform them that although I 've obtained full time employment, I 'm still not capable to make full mortgage payment. I was told that due to my account being delinquent that I was being sent to foreclosure. I constantly tried to work with Bank of America. I involved NACA and Home Owners Assistance programs. I kept receiving information that stated there 's no proof I live in the property. To which, I told the representative that they all are more than welcome to come over for dinner and see differently. This went on for a year. I routinely submitted the necessary documents to prove my case. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I 'm about 22,000 behind in my mortgage and I still want my home. Bank of America is not willing to help me retain my home. Instead they either want the XXXX or the home will go to foreclosure. Because I am still getting the threats of foreclosure, I am choosing to save my mortgage payments in the event I am locked out of my home by the time I get back. Not to mention, the home is not worth NEARLY the amount I owe on it. Homes in the area have sold between XXXX and XXXX. I currently owe XXXX. Even if I choose to do a short sale, I 'll still owe more than the home is worth. To proceed with the foreclosure, the home has been appraised at only XXXX.",Mortgage
